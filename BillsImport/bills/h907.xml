United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015

(Sec. 3) States that it should be U.S. policy to support the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its response to the Syrian refugee crisis, cooperate with Jordan to combat the terrorist threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or other terrorist organizations, and help secure Jordan's borders with Syria and Iraq.

(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that expeditious consideration of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense articles, defense services, design and construction services, and major defense equipment to Jordan is fully consistent with U.S. security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of world peace and security.

(Sec. 5) Includes Jordan for three years among the countries eligible for certain streamlined defense sales, licensing agreements, and technical assistance under the Arms Export Control Act.

(Sec. 6) Authorizes the Department of State to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Jordan to increase military cooperation, including joint military exercises, personnel exchanges, support for international peacekeeping missions, and enhanced strategic dialogue.</summary>
