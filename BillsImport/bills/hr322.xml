  <summary>6/17/2015--Introduced.
Recognizes the unique challenges facing children who are growing up with one or both parents in prison.

Recognizes that more resources and services need to target the specific needs of children of incarcerated parents in order to reduce the cycle of families in the criminal justice system.

Supports research and the building of community partnerships to provide a comprehensive plan to meet the needs of individual children struggling to balance the difficulties of academic, social, and economic stability while a parent is incarcerated.

Supports strengthening the access parents have to health care, education, housing, and job training services so they can be productive role models for their children post-release from a correctional institution.</summary>
