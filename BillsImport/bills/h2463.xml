Dispose Responsibly of your Pills Act of 2015 or the DROP Act of 2015

Authorizes the Attorney General, in coordination with the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, to make grants to eligible entities to expand or make available disposal sites for unwanted prescription medications.

Defines "eligible entity" to include:

 a state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency; a manufacturer, distributor, or reverse distributor of prescription medications; a retail pharmacy; a registered narcotic treatment program; a hospital or clinic with an on-site pharmacy; and an eligible long-term care facility. Requires a recipient to use a grant for:

 expenses of a prescription drug disposal site; implementing disposal procedures and processes and community education strategies; replicating a prescription drug take back initiative throughout multiple jurisdictions; and training of law enforcement officers and other community participants. Limits grants to not more than $250,000 for not longer than two years.

Directs the Attorney General to make a grant: (1) to provide technical assistance and training for a grant recipient, and (2) for evaluation of each recipient's performance. Requires recipients to report each fiscal year on: (1) the effectiveness of their prescription drug take back programs, and (2) the effect of disposal efforts on drug circulation.</summary>
