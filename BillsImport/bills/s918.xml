Notice for Organizations That Include Charities is Essential (NOTICE) Act

(Sec. 2) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Department of the Treasury to notify any tax-exempt organization, not later than 300 days after such an organization fails to file its annual tax return or other required information for 2 consecutive years, that: (1) the Internal Revenue Service has no record of its return or&#160;information&#160;for 2 consecutive years, and (2) a penalty will occur if the organization fails to file&#160;its&#160;return or&#160;information by the next filing deadline.&#160;Allows the reinstatement of the tax-exempt status of such an organization without the requirement of an application if: (1) the organization demonstrates to the satisfaction of Treasury that it did not receive the notice required by this Act, and (2) it files an annual return or required&#160;information for the current year. Makes this Act applicable to notices and returns required to be filed after December 31, 2014.</summary>
