No Exemption for Washington from Obamacare Act

This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to extend the requirement for participation in a health insurance exchange to the President, Vice President, executive branch political appointees, and employees of congressional committees and leadership offices of Congress. Currently, this requirement applies to Members of Congress and their staff.

The government is prohibited from contributing to or subsidizing the health insurance coverage of officials and employees subject to this requirement.</summary>
