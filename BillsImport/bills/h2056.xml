  <summary>4/28/2015--Introduced.
Computer Science Career Education Act of 2015

This bill directs the Department of Education to award competitive grants to consortia composed of at least one local educational agency, at least one institution of higher education (IHE), and community representatives for the development and operation of four- or six-year computer science career education programs.

Each such career education program must include the development of a computer science program for both secondary and postsecondary education that:

 is aligned with rigorous computer science standards for kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education; links secondary schools and IHEs through non-duplicative sequences of courses in computer science career fields; uses, if appropriate and available, experiential or work-based learning in collaboration with local or regional employers; uses educational technology and distance learning to involve all members of the consortium more fully in the development and operation of the programs; aligns with industry needs in the state or region; and creates innovative opportunities for students that lead to attainment of industry-recognized credentials. A program must also provide: (1) professional development for teachers, (2) career and academic counseling for students, and (3) equal access to the full range of career education programs to members of underrepresented groups and special populations.</summary>
