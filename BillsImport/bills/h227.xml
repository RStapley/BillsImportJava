  <summary>1/8/2015--Introduced.
This bill prohibits the use of funds for certain immigration-related policies, including executive orders or any other executive policy issued after March 11, 2011, that provides for parole, employment authorization, deferred action, or any other immigration benefit or relief for individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States (with exceptions for asylum, temporary protected status, or cancellation of removal by an immigration judge).

The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to: (1) exclude from the definition of "unauthorized alien," with respect to the unlawful employment of aliens, any alien otherwise admitted to and lawfully present in the United States; and (2) consider an alien without lawful status to be an unauthorized alien whose employment is unlawful.</summary>
