Stop Deceptive Advertising for Women's Services Act

Requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate rules to prohibit, as an unfair and deceptive act or practice, a person from advertising with the intent to deceptively create the impression that: (1) such person is a provider of abortion services if such person does not provide such services, or (2) such person is not a provider of abortion services if such person does provide such services.

Defines "abortion services" as providing surgical and non-surgical procedures to terminate a pregnancy, or providing referrals for such procedures.

Sets forth the enforcement authority of the FTC, including with respect to nonprofit organizations.</summary>
