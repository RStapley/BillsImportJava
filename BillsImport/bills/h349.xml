Great Lakes and Fresh Water Algal Bloom Information Act 

This bill requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to create an online database of research and information on the causes and corrective actions being taken with regard to algal blooms in the Great Lakes, their tributaries, and other surface fresh waters. NOAA must include relevant chemical, physical, and biological data that have been collected by an accredited university, association or organization, research group, federal agency, state, or local government in the United States or Canada.

This bill does not grant NOAA any new authority, including the authority to require submission of data.</summary>
