  <summary>5/1/2015--Introduced.
State Wide Interoperable Communications Enhancement Act or the SWIC Enhancement Act

 Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require a state to include in its application for State Homeland Security Grant Program funding a certification: (1) that the governor of the state has designated a Statewide Interoperability Coordinator, or (2) indicating that the state is performing the functions of such a Coordinator in another manner and identifying the primary point of contact for performance of such functions.

Sets forth as such Coordinator's functions:

 overseeing the daily operations of the state's interoperability efforts; coordinating state interoperability and communications projects and grant applications for such projects; establishing and maintaining working groups to develop and implement key interoperability initiatives; and implementing and updating a Statewide Communications Interoperability Plan that specifies the current status of state efforts to enhance communications interoperability within the state, including future goals for communications interoperability among emergency response agencies in the state.</summary>
