NCUA Budget Transparency Act

This bill instructs the Comptroller General to study the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) in order to:

 examine the process and procedures related to NCUA budgeting practices; identify areas where the NCUA can provide greater budget transparency to Members of Congress, the NCUA's regulated entities, and the public; and determine the availability of line-by-line budget data for the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility, and the Temporary Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund.</summary>
