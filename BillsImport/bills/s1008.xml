Requires the Office of E-Government and Information Technology to: (1) establish the deadline each year for agencies to submit information required by this Act; (2) develop and publish a goal for the total amount of planned cost savings through the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative during a five-year period and report on the actual savings achieved through the Initiative; and (3) report to Congress on data center cost savings.
