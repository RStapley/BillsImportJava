  <summary>7/14/2015--Passed Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)

Adoptive Family Relief Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to declare that, if an immigrant visa was issued on or after March 27, 2013, for a child who has been lawfully adopted, or who is coming to the United States to be adopted, by a U.S. citizen, any statutory immigrant visa fees relating to a renewal or replacement of such visa may be waived or, if already paid, may be refunded if:

 the child was unable to use the original immigrant visa during the period of its validity as a direct result of extraordinary circumstances, including the denial of an exit permit; and such inability was attributable to factors beyond the control of the adopting parent or parents.</summary>
