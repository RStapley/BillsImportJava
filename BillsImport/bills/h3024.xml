  <summary>7/10/2015--Introduced.
This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to repeal the prohibition against, and so permit, administrative or judicial review of any estimate used and any period selected for determining additional Medicare disproportionate share hospital payments to subsection (d) hospitals.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
