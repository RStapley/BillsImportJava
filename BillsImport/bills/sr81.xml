  <summary>2/12/2015--Passed Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Encourages: (1) all federal entities to treat children trafficked for sex as victims or survivors of rape and sex trafficking; and (2) lawmakers, law enforcement, the media, and the public to reframe the trafficking of children for sex as an act of violence against children.

Expresses support for: (1) efforts to arrest and prosecute sex traffickers and buyers of children trafficked for sex in accordance with applicable state and federal sex trafficking statutes and state child protection laws; (2) survivors of child sex trafficking and efforts to raise awareness of the comprehensive services necessary to heal from the trauma of sexual violence and exploitation; and (3) ending the demand for children in the commercial sex market by ensuring that children in the United States are not for sale and that any person who is trafficking or purchasing a child for sex is punished under the full force of the law.</summary>
