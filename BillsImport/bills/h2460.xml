  <summary>5/19/2015--Introduced.
This bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to enter into an agreement or a contract with each state home to pay for adult day health care for a veteran eligible for, but not receiving, nursing home care.

The veteran must need such care either specifically for a service-connected disability, or, if not specifically for one, the veteran must have a service-connected disability rated 70% or more.

Payment under each agreement or contract between the Secretary and a state home must equal 65% of the payment that the Secretary would otherwise pay to the state home if the veteran were receiving nursing home care.</summary>
