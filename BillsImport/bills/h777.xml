  <summary>2/5/2015--Introduced.
Permanent Investment in Health Research Act of 2015 

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to make appropriations to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for FY2016-FY2025:

 for FY2016, $32 billion; and for each fiscal year from FY2017-FY2025, the amount appropriated for the preceding fiscal year, adjusted by any percentage increase in nominal gross domestic product during the preceding calendar year. The bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to add NIH to the list of programs and activities exempt from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.</summary>
