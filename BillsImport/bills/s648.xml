  <summary>3/4/2015--Introduced.
Medicare Formulary Improvement Act of 2015

This bill amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to require a sponsor offering a prescription drug plan (PDP) to include all covered part D drugs in the following categories and classes of drugs in the formulary: (1) anticonvulsants, (2) antidepressants, (3) antineoplastics, (4) antipsychotics, (5) antiretrovirals, and (6) immunosuppressants for the treatment of transplant rejection. Currently the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to identify categories and classes of drugs of clinical concern.

The Secretary is required, however, to establish any exceptions that permit a PDP sponsor to exclude from its formulary a particular covered part D drug only through promulgation of a regulation, including a public notice and comment period.</summary>
