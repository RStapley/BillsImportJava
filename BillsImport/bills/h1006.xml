Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award matching grants to enable states to implement scholarship programs to ensure an adequate supply of health professionals.

Authorizes HHS to award grants to assist medical schools in developing and strengthening primary care mentorship programs and cultivating leaders in primary care among its students.

Requires HHS to award grants to medical and other health professions schools to promote priority competencies that are selected annually by the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care and Dentistry, in order to foster curricular innovations to improve the education and training of health care providers.

Directs the Institute of Medicine to study the documentation requirements for cognitive services (evaluation and management services) required under Medicare and Medicaid and through private health insurers.</summary>
