Securing Expedited Screening Act

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security shall limit access to expedited airport security screening at airport security checkpoints to only a passenger who:

 voluntarily submits biographic and biometric information for a security risk assessment and has an approved PreCheck program application; is traveling as air transportation security or a member of the Armed Forces, including any accompanying family member; has been designated by the TSA as known and low-risk; or is 75 years or older, or 12 years or younger and traveling with a parent or guardian who is a participant in the PreCheck program. The TSA may provide access to expedited airport security screening to additional passengers through an alternate method upon submission to Congress of an independent assessment of its security effectiveness.</summary>
