Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery for Cities Underfunded Because of Size Act of 2015 or TIGER CUBS Act 

This bill provides $500 million in supplemental FY2015 appropriations to the Department of Transportation for national infrastructure investments under a competitive grant program commonly known as the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program. At least $100 million of the funds must be used for projects located in cities with populations between 10,000 and 50,000.

The funding provided by this bill is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. This funding is only available if the President designates the amounts as an emergency and submits the designation to Congress.</summary>
