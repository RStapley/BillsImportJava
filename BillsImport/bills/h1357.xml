Veterans Beneficiary Fraud Enforcement Act

This bill prohibits a Veterans' Group Life Insurance insuree from designating as a beneficiary any Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who is in a position of trust with the insured. (Such prohibition includes any doctor, caregiver, or caseworker working directly with the insured, unless such employee is the insured's spouse, child, parent, or other next of kin.)

The VA shall refer to an appropriate legal authority any incident of suspected or alleged fraud relating to a beneficiary designation under any Veterans' Group Life Insurance.</summary>
