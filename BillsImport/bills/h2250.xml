It includes funding for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and Joint Items such as the Joint Economic Committee, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies of 2017, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Office of the Attending Physician.

It also provides appropriations for the Capitol Police, the Office of Compliance, the Congressional Budget Office, the Architect of the Capitol, the Library of Congress, the Government Publishing Office, and the Government Accountability Office.

Pursuant to a longstanding practice under which each chamber of Congress determines its own requirements, funds for the House are included in this bill at the level approved by the House in H.R. 2250.

The bill increases overall legislative branch funding above the FY2015 level and also increases funding for the Senate, the Capitol Police, the Government Accountability Office, and the Library of Congress.

The bill decreases funding below FY2015 levels for the Architect of the Capitol and the Government Publishing Office.

The bill also prohibits a cost of living adjustment for Members of Congress, provides a payment to the widow of the late Representative Alan Nunnelee, permits the installation of battery charging stations in Library of Congress parking areas, and prohibits or restricts the delivery to House offices of printed copies of legislation and materials such as the Congressional Record and the U.S. Code.
