Knife Owners' Protection Act of 2015

 Entitles any person who is not otherwise prohibited by federal law from possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a knife to transport a knife from any place where such person may lawfully possess, carry, or transport such a knife to any other place where such person may lawfully do so: (1) by motor vehicle if the knife is not directly accessible from the passenger compartment or is in a locked container, glove compartment, or console; or (2) by other means over land or through water or the air if the knife is in a locked container.

Allows any knife or tool designed for enabling escape in an emergency incorporating a blunt tipped safety blade, a guarded blade, or both for cutting safety belts to be carried in the passenger compartment without being secured in a locked container, glove compartment, or console, except in the passenger cabin of aircraft whose passengers are subject to airport screening procedures of the Transportation Security Administration.</summary>
