VA Accountability Act of 2015

This bill authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to remove or demote a VA employee based on performance or misconduct.

The VA may also remove such individual from the civil service or demote the individual through a reduction in grade or annual pay rate.

An employee shall have the right to an appeal before the Merit Systems Protection Board within seven days of removal or demotion. An administrative judge shall have to make a final decision within 45 days of such appeal or the original decision becomes final.

The VA may not remove or demote an employee without the approval of the Special Counsel if the individual seeks corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel based on an alleged prohibited personnel practice.

The appointment of an individual to a permanent position within the competitive service or as a career appointee within the Senior Executive Service shall become final after an 18-month probationary period, which the Secretary may extend. Final appointment to a permanent hire shall be made by the employee's supervisor.

The Government Accountability Office shall study the amount of time spent by VA employees carrying out labor organizing activities and the amount of Department space used for such activities.</summary>
