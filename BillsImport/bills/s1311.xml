Oil Spill Deterrent Act 

This bill amends: (1) the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 to increase from $5,000 to $100,000 the civil penalty for failure to take corrective action pertaining to drilling violations on federal land, and (2) the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to increase from $20,000 to $250,000 the civil penalty for failure to take corrective action pertaining to drilling violations on the Outer Continental Shelf.
