This bill amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) (OASDI) and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to direct the Commissioner of Social Security to conduct pre-effectuation and post-effectuation quality reviews of hearing dispositions with respect to decisions in connection with applications for OASDI or SSI benefits, in a sufficient number to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and other guidance.

The Commissioner shall report annually Congress on: (1) the total number of cases selected for quality review, (2) the number in which a decision is remanded, and (3) the number in which a decision is modified or reversed.</summary>
