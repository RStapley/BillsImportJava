  <summary>1/7/2015--Introduced.
This bill prohibits the head of any federal agency from implementing or enforcing any regulations, proposals, or actions establishing any carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions reductions until the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Information Administration, and Department of Commerce certify in writing that China, India, and Russian have proposed, implemented, and enforced measures requiring substantially similar reductions.

Any regulation, proposal, or action that requires those emission reductions and that is in effect before this certification is made is nullified.</summary>
