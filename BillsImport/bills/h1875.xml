Filipino Veterans Recognition Act

This bill amends the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make a payment from the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund to an eligible person who, during the one-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this paragraph, submits to the Secretary:

 a benefits claim; or with respect to a person who filed a benefits claim during such one-year period, a new claim or an appeal to such previously filed claim. In determining an individual's eligibility to receive Compensation Fund benefits the Secretary shall accept as proof of service an affidavit from the government of the Philippines certifying an eligible individual's service (AGO Form 23).

 Such an affidavit shall serve as proof of service regardless of whether the eligible individual:

 submits any other qualifying document, or is included in the Approved Revised Reconstructed Guerilla Roster of 1948, (Missouri List). The Secretary may not accept such an affidavit as proof of service for any VA benefit other than the Compensation Fund.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing additional amounts to be appropriated to the Compensation Fund.</summary>
