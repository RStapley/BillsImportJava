      <text>POINT OF ORDER AGAINST CONSIDERATION - Mr. Polis made a point of order against consideration of H. Res. 125 on the grounds that it violated section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Chair announced that the point of order met the threshold burden under the rule and recognized Mr. Polis and a Member opposed for up to twenty minutes of debate, equally divided and controlled, on the question of consideration. Following debate, the Chair would then put the question of consideration as the statutory means of disposing of the point of order.</text>
