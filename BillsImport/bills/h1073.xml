  <summary>2/25/2015--Introduced.
Critical Infrastructure Protection Act or CIPA

 Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) include EM threats in national planning scenarios; and (2) conduct a campaign to proactively educate owners and operators of critical infrastructure, emergency planners, and emergency responders at all levels of government about EM threats. Defines "EM threat" to mean an electromagnetic pulse caused by: (1) a nuclear or non-nuclear device, including by an act of terrorism; or (2) a geomagnetic disturbance or other naturally occurring phenomenon.

Directs DHS to conduct research and development to mitigate the consequences of EM threats, including: (1) an objective scientific analysis of the risks to critical infrastructures from a range of EM threats; (2) determination of the critical national security assets and vital civic utilities and infrastructures that are at risk from EM threats; (3) an evaluation of emergency planning and response technologies that would address the findings and recommendations of experts, including those of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack; (4) an analysis of available technology options to improve the resiliency of critical infrastructure to EM threats; and (5) the restoration and recovery capabilities of critical infrastructure under differing levels of damage and disruption from various EM threats.

Includes among the responsibilities of DHS, relating to intelligence and analysis and infrastructure protection, to prepare and submit to specified congressional committees: (1) a comprehensive plan to protect and prepare the critical infrastructure of the American homeland against EM threats, including from acts of terrorism; and (2) biennial updates of such plan.</summary>
