Hospice Commitment to Accurate and Relevant Encounters Act or the Hospice CARE [sic]

 Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act with respect to the face-to-face encounter framework in hospice care. A clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant, or other health professional (in addition to a hospice physician or a nurse practitioner, as under current law) is allowed to conduct the face-to-face encounter with the individual to determine continued eligibility for hospice care before the first 60-day (currently 180-day) recertification period and each subsequent recertification.</summary>
