  <summary>6/4/2015--Introduced.
Open Our Democracy Act of 2015 

 Requires all candidates for election to the Senate and the House of Representatives to run in an open primary, regardless of political party preference or lack thereof.

Limits the ensuing general election to the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes in the open primary.

Gives candidates the option, at the time of filing to run for office, to declare a political party preference, which does not constitute or imply endorsement of the candidate by the party designated.

Treats the general election day in the same manner as a legal public holiday for purposes of federal employment.

Expresses the sense of Congress that private employers should give their employees a day off on the general election day in November 2016 and each even-numbered year thereafter to enable them to cast votes in elections held on that day.

Directs the Government Accountability Office to study the procedures used by states to conduct congressional redistricting.</summary>
