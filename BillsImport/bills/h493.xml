  <summary>1/22/2015--Introduced.
Clarification of Legal Enforcement Against Non-criminal Energy Producers Act of 2015 or the CLEAN Energy Producers Act of 2015

This bill amends the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to require the Department of the Interior to issue or deny an eagle permit for no less than 30 years that authorizes the taking of a bald eagle or golden eagle that is incidental to, but not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. If Interior fails to act on a permit within a reasonable time (not exceeding one year), the permit is deemed issued.

This bill amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to exempt from criminal liability any taking, killing, or other harm to a migratory bird that is accidental or incidental to the presence or operation of an otherwise lawful activity.</summary>
