  <summary>1/6/2015--Introduced.
This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require: (1) the reinstatement of the tax-exempt status of a tax-exempt subsidiary organization with fewer than 50 members whose tax-exempt status was revoked due to failure to file required tax returns or notices, and (2) a waiver of any user fee charged in connection with a reinstatement application. As a condition for reinstatement, the organization must file any required returns or notices.</summary>
