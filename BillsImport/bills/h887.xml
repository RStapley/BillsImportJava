  <summary>3/13/2015--Reported to House amended, Part I.
Electronic Health Fairness Act of 2015 

(Sec. 2) Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit for a payment year after 2015 any patient encounter of an eligible professional occurring at an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) from being treated as such a patient encounter in determining whether an eligible professional qualifies as a meaningful electronic health record (EHR) user.

Terminates this prohibition three years after the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines, through notice and comment rulemaking, that certified EHR technology is applicable to the ASC setting.</summary>
