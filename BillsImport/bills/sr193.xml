  <summary>6/4/2015--Introduced.
Celebrates the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut.

Recognizes the value of the publicly funded family planning safety net in helping to realize the promise of Griswold and that: (1) birth control constitutes basic health care for women, (2) affordable contraceptives remain inaccessible to many poor and low-income women, and (3) investments in publicly funded family planning services help prevent unplanned pregnancies and abortions and help save taxpayer dollars.

Encourages robust investment in publicly funded family planning services as a means to help women plan pregnancies and have healthier babies.

Acknowledges that all women should have affordable access to the tools that help women plan and space their pregnancies.</summary>
