Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act

(Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of State to designate a Department of State (Department) employee at the Assistant Secretary level or above to serve concurrently as the U.S. Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection to:

 coordinate and promote federal agency efforts to address international cultural property protection activities; support activities to assist countries that are the principle sources of trafficked cultural property to protect cultural heritage sites and to prevent cultural property looting and theft; develop strategies to reduce illegal trade and trafficking in international cultural property in the United States and abroad, including by reducing consumer demand for such trade; and Chair the Coordinating Committee on International Cultural Property Protection. (Sec. 5) Establishes a Coordinating Committee on International Cultural Property Protection to facilitate the Coordinator's work.

(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary, through the U.S. Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection, to report to Congress annually for seven years regarding activities of the U.S. Coordinator and the Coordinating Committee, the Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice to protect international cultural property.

(Sec. 7) Authorizes any agency involved in international cultural property protection activities to enter into agreements with the Smithsonian Institution to engage Smithsonian personnel temporarily to assist in such activities.

(Sec. 8) Directs the President to apply specified import restrictions with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of Syria as if Syria were a State Party to the Convention on prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property.

 Sets forth the conditions for termination of such restrictions.

 Authorizes the President to waive such import restrictions for specified cultural property if the President certifies to Congress that:

 the foreign owner or custodian of the specified cultural property has requested that such property be temporarily located in the United States for protection purposes, such property shall be returned upon request to the foreign owner or custodian, and the grant of a waiver will not contribute to illegal trafficking in cultural property or financing of criminal or terrorist activities.</summary>
