School Social Workers Improving Student Success Act

This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education to award renewable grants to high-need local educational agencies to retain or hire additional school social workers.

Grantees may use the funds to reimburse school social workers for expenses they incur in rendering services.

Grant-funded social workers must target their services to the highest-need students.

Grant funds may not be used to supplant other funds used for hiring and retaining school social workers.</summary>
