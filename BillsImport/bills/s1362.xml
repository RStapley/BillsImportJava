  <summary>8/5/2015--Passed Senate amended.
This bill amends title XI of the Social Security Act to authorize the Department of Health and Human Services to waive applicable general and Medicaid requirements of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for Elderly (PACE) in order to conduct demonstration projects through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovations (CMMI) that involve PACE. Prohibits HHS, however, as part of a CMMI demonstration, from waiving: (1) the requirement to offer items and services under Medicare and Medicaid without limitation to PACE program enrollees, and (2) certain requirements regarding enrollment in and disenrollment from PACE programs.</summary>
