  <summary>4/22/2015--Introduced.
Sunset Inefficient and Unaccountable Government Act

This bill requires the abolishment of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, the Interior, the Treasury, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation on specified dates of between 2 years and 11 years after enactment of this Act or every 10 years thereafter, and of any other agency about which Congress has not passed a concurrent resolution disapproving abolishment during the previous 10 years, unless a disapproval of such abolishment is enacted prior to the date of the agency's scheduled abolishment.

The head of each agency which is scheduled to be abolished must: (1) take necessary actions to dispose of the assets, obligations, and liabilities of the agency during the one-year period that begins on the date of abolishment; and (2) report to Congress on the roles and responsibilities of the agency, detailing the agency's justification for existence, including areas where the duties of the agency may overlap with the duties of other agencies.</summary>
