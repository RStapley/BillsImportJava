Modular Airborne Firefighting System Flexibility Act 

This bill authorizes the National Guard to provide assistance to support federal, state, or other civilian authority firefighting operations or activities, including aerial firefighting employment of the Modular Airborne Firefighting System.

Such authority is based on a recognition of the basic premises of the National Incident Management System and the National Response Framework that: (1) incidents are typically managed at the local level first; and (2) local jurisdictions retain command, control, and authority over response activities for their jurisdictional areas.</summary>
