Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Directs the President, acting through appropriate federal agencies, to:

 facilitate the commercial exploration and utilization of space resources to meet national needs; discourage government barriers to the development of economically viable, safe, and stable industries for the exploration and utilization of space resources in manners consistent with the existing international obligations of the United States; and promote the right of U.S. commercial entities to explore outer space and utilize space resources, in accordance with such obligations, free from harmful interference, and to transfer or sell such resources. Defines "space resource" as a natural resource of any kind found in place in outer space.

Directs the President to make recommendations to Congress for: (1) the allocation of responsibilities relating to the exploration and utilization of space resources among federal agencies, and (2) any authorities necessary to meet U.S. international obligations with respect to such exploration and resource utilization.

Declares that any asteroid resources obtained in outer space are the property of the entity that obtained them, which shall be entitled to all property rights to them, consistent with applicable federal law and existing international obligations.

States that a U.S. commercial space resource utilization entity:

 shall avoid causing harmful interference in outer space, and may bring a civil action in a U.S. district court for any action by another entity subject to U.S. jurisdiction causing harmful interference to its operations with respect to an asteroid resource utilization activity in outer space.</summary>
