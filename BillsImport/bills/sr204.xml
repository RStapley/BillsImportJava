  <summary>7/14/2015--Passed Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of the United States to promote the safety, health, and well-being of the millions of refugees and displaced persons who flee war, persecution, and torture.

 Calls upon the U.S. government to: (1) continue its international leadership role in response to those who have been displaced, including the most vulnerable populations who endure sexual violence, human trafficking, forced conscription, and genocide; and (2) find political solutions to existing conflicts and prevent new conflicts from beginning.

Commends those who have risked their lives working individually and for nongovernmental organizations and international agencies that have provided assistance and protection for persons displaced by conflict.</summary>
