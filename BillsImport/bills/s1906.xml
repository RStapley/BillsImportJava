Orphan Drug Fairness Act

This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) to exclude sales of any drug or biological product approved by the Food and Drug Administration solely for rare diseases or conditions (orphan drug) from the calculation of the annual fee on manufacturers or importers with branded prescription drug sales exceeding $5 million.

This Act is effective as if included in PPACA.</summary>
