  <summary>5/8/2015--Introduced.
This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE), acting through the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, to submit to Congress a plan to establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve for the storage, in strategically located facilities, of spare large power transformers in sufficient numbers to temporarily replace critically damaged large power transformers.

DOE may not establish a Strategic Transformer Reserve until Congress has approved the plan.</summary>
