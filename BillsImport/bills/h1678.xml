  <summary>3/26/2015--Introduced.
National Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Resilience and Security Act of 2015

Directs the Department of Defense to provide for the establishment of a reliable land-based positioning, navigation, and timing system to complement and back up the global positioning system (GPS) to ensure the availability of uncorrupted or non-degraded signals for military and civilian users if GPS signals are corrupted, degraded, unreliable, or otherwise unavailable.

Requires the system to: (1) be wireless, terrestrial, and wide-area; (2) provide a precise, high-power 100 kilohertz signal; (3) be able to penetrate underground and inside buildings; (4) take advantage of existing, unused government long-range navigation system (LORAN) infrastructure and work in concert with enhanced long-range navigation systems (eLORAN); and (5) incorporate private sector expertise.</summary>
