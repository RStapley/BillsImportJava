Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize trauma care programs through FY2020.

(Sec. 3) Grants for pilot projects of innovative models of emergency care and trauma systems can be allocated up to half of the remaining funds for trauma care after allocations for improvement of emergency medical services in rural areas and administrative purposes.

State plans for emergency medical services are required to include the national standards and requirements of the American Burn Association for verified burn centers.

The Department of Health and Human Services must update the model plan for designation of trauma centers and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies, taking into account standards from the American Burn Association.</summary>
