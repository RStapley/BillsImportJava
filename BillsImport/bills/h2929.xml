  <summary>6/25/2015--Introduced.
Supporting Home Owner Rights Enforcement Act

Amends the Federal Power Act, regarding the issuance of licenses for construction of dams, conduits, and reservoirs, to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when deciding whether to issue a license for project works, to give equal consideration to minimizing infringement on the useful exercise and enjoyment of property rights held by nonlicensees.

Requires the licensee, in developing any recreational resource within the project boundary, to consider private landownership as a means to encourage and facilitate private investment, increased tourism, and recreational use.</summary>
