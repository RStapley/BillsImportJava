  <summary>2/25/2015--Introduced.
Fair and Transparent Stakeholder Involvement Fee Act 

This bill prohibits the Department of Agriculture (USDA) from issuing or enforcing a final rule based on the proposed rule entitled "User Fees for Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Services." The proposed rule adds new fee categories and adjusts current fees charged for certain agricultural quarantine and inspection services that are provided in connection with vessels, trucks, railroad cars, aircraft, and international passengers arriving at ports in the customs territory of the United States.

The bill also prohibits USDA from issuing a final rule for quarantine and inspection fees authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade (FACT) Act of 1990, except in compliance with negotiated rulemaking procedures.</summary>
