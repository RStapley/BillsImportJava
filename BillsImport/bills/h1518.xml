Let It Go Act

Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to allow the use of contributions or donations only for the six years following the most recent federal election for a six-year office (i.e., election to the Senate) in which an individual was a candidate for the office if that individual is not a candidate for that office during those ensuing six years.

Requires contributions or donations remaining available to to such an individual after such six-year period ends to be disposed of within 30 days, as follows: (1) to pay any debts or obligations owed in connection with the campaign for that office; (2) to return those contributions or donations to the individuals, entities, or both, who made them; (3) to make contributions to a charitable organization; and (4) to make transfers to a national, state or local committee of a political party.</summary>
