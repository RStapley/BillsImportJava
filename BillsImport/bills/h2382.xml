Enable More Parents to Opt-Out Without Endangering Resources Act

This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require states to allow a student to opt out, for any reason stated by the student's parent and without any penalty or other consequence, of yearly academic assessments used as the primary means of determining the performance of the state and of each local educational agency and school in enabling all children to meet the state's academic achievement standards.</summary>
