Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that:

 only Congress has the constitutional authority to declare war according to article 1, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution; the President should set clear objectives for the U.S. Armed Forces before committing them to battle; and the President should provide Congress with a clear and definitive deployment and troop commitment plan before engaging in hostilities against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). States that the House should not approve a request for the Use of Military Force against ISIS:

 unless the President provides Congress with requested information, and if the President commits to defeating ISIS using temporary duty assignment as a main means of troop deployment.</summary>
