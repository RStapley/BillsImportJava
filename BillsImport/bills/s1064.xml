Family Asthma Act

Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to collaborate with state and local health departments to: (1) conduct activities regarding asthma, including deterring the harmful consequences of uncontrolled asthma, and disseminating health education and information regarding prevention of asthma episodes and strategies for managing asthma; and (2) develop state plans incorporating public health responses to reduce the burden of asthma, particularly regarding disproportionately affected populations.

 Revises and expands requirements for asthma surveillance activities.

 Requires the CDC to coordinate data collection activities to maximize the comparability of results.

Requires the Department of Health and Human Services to submit an assessment of current activities related to asthma prevention, management, and surveillance along with recommendations for the future direction of asthma activities.</summary>
