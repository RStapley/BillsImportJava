Shrinking Emergency Account Losses Act of 2015 or the SEAL Act

Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to loans made from a qualified employer pension plan, to: (1) extend the period for repayment of loans if a plan terminates or a plan participant becomes unemployed, and (2) prohibit plans from allowing the use of credit cards or similar arrangements to access loan amounts.

Requires the Secretary of the Treasury to modify regulations governing hardship distributions from qualified employer pension plans to allow participants to make additional contributions to a plan during the six month period following a hardship distribution.</summary>
