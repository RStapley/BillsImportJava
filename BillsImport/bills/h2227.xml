  <summary>5/1/2015--Introduced.
Strengthening The Resiliency of Our Nation on the Ground Act or the STRONG Act.

 Requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy, with input from the Department of Homeland Security, to establish and chair an interagency working group with cabinet-level representation from all relevant federal agencies in order to: (1) provide a strategic vision of extreme weather resilience; (2) conduct a gap and overlap analysis of current and planned federal activities related to achieving short- and long-term resilience to extreme weather and its impacts on the United States, such as flooding and drought; and (3) develop a National Extreme Weather Resilience Action Plan.

Requires the Plan to include the establishment of an online, publicly available information portal to be used by federal agencies and other stakeholders that directs users to key data and tools to inform resilience-enhancing efforts and to build off and complement existing federal efforts. Provides for a coordinating entity to establish and maintain such portal.

Requires such coordinating entity to coordinate the implementation of the Plan and to track its progress.

Requires the submission of specified reports.</summary>
