  <summary>4/21/2015--Introduced.
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992 which would:

 mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the Annex I Parties unless the protocol or agreement also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Non-Annex I Parties within the same compliance period, not ensure that all parties to the agreement reduce an equal amount of greenhouse gas emissions at an equivalent rate within the same compliance period, result in serious harm to the U.S. economy, and not adequately protect U.S. intellectual property rights.</summary>
