Wounded Veterans Recreation Act of 2015

Amends the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to require the National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass to be made available at no charge to, and for the lifetime of, any veteran with a service-connected disability. (The Pass is currently made available at no charge to, and for the lifetime of, any U.S. citizen or person domiciled in the United States who has been medically determined to be permanently disabled.)

Requires the entrance fees charged those who do not have a free National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass to be adjusted to maintain total receipts.</summary>
