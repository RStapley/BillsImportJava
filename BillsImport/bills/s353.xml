  <summary>2/3/2015--Introduced.
Justice Safety Valve Act of 2015 

This bill authorizes a federal court to impose a sentence in a criminal proceeding that is below the minimum sentence&#160;required by statute if the court finds that a lower sentence is necessary to avoid violating statutory factors that the court must consider in imposing a sentence. The court must give parties to the proceeding notice of its intent to impose a lower sentence and state in writing the factors requiring&#160;such a sentence. This bill does not limit any right to appeal that would otherwise exist.</summary>
