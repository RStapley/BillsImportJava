  <summary>2/13/2015--Introduced.
Working Parent Support Act of 2015

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow taxpayers who do not otherwise itemize their tax deductions&#160;a&#160;deduction from gross income&#160;(above-the-line deduction)&#160;for their&#160;employment-related expenses incurred in caring for a child under the age of 13 or a child who is physicaly or mentaly incapable of self care (qualifying child). Limits the dollar amount of such deduction in a taxable year&#160;to $7,000 for taxpayers with one qualifying child or $14,000 for taxpayers with two or more qualifying children. Allows an annual inflation adjustment to such amounts for taxable years beginning after 2015.</summary>
