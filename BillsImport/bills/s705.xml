  <summary>3/11/2015--Introduced.
This bill permits the federal share requirements applicable to the transportation alternatives program (TAP) to be met based on: (1) an individual project or activity, or (2) a program of projects or activities.

In the allocation of funds for transportation alternatives, 66.67% (increased from 50%) of reserved funds per fiscal year shall be obligated to any eligible entity in proportion to its relative shares of the state population in: (1) urbanized areas with a population of over 200,000, (2) non-urban areas with a population greater than 5,000, and (3) other areas of the state.

Certain not-for-profit entities and metropolitan planning organizations are now eligible to be TAP project sponsors.

 A state's authority to opt out of the recreational trails program is repealed.

Each state or metropolitan planning organization responsible for carrying out TAP requirements must report annually to the Department of Transportation on the the number of TAP project applications received and the number of projects selected for funding.</summary>
