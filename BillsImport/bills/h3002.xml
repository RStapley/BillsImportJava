Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act 

Prohibits a state or local government from receiving federal financial assistance for a minimum of one year if it restricts or prohibits a government entity or official from: (1) sending to or receiving from the responsible federal immigration agency information regarding an individual's citizenship or immigration status, or (2) maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's status.

Restores assistance eligibility upon a Department of Justice (DOJ) determination that the jurisdiction no longer restricts or prohibits such actions.

Directs DOJ to report each year to Congress regarding state or local jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit such actions.</summary>
