This bill amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to require the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to publicly disclose crop insurance premium subsidies paid on behalf of Members of Congress and their immediate families, Cabinet Secretaries and their immediate families, or entities of which any of these individuals is a majority shareholder.
