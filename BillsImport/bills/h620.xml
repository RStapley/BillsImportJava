  <summary>1/28/2015--Introduced.
CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act of 2015 

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny a publicly held corporation a tax deduction for the payment of performance-based remuneration in excess of $1 million to any of its current or former&#160;officers or directors if such corporation does not meet the pay fairness requirement established by this Act. Deems the pay fairness requirement to be satisfied if: (1) the average compensation paid by the&#160;employer for all applicable U.S. employees for the taxable year&#160;exceeds the inflation and productivity growth adjusted average (i.e., $118,450 in 2015)&#160;of such compensation&#160;for the preceding taxable year; and (2) the aggregate compensation paid by the employer to or for all applicable employees for the taxable year&#160;is not less than the aggregate of such compensation for the preceding taxable year.</summary>
