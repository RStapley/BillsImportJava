  <summary>1/14/2015--Introduced.
This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make an alien who commits or conspires to commit a single human trafficking offense (under current law, more than one offense), or assists a trafficker, ineligible for U.S. admission.

Makes the spouse, son, or daughter of such an inadmissible alien also permanently inadmissible if he or she has obtained a financial or other benefit from that alien's illicit activity, regardless of when the benefit was obtained, and knew that the benefit was the product of such illicit activity.</summary>
