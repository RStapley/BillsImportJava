  <summary>6/25/2015--Passed Senate amended.
Directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convey to the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation in Bethel, Alaska, all interest of the United States in certain property (including all land and appurtenances) containing 22.98 acres, for use in connection with health and social services programs.

States that this conveyance by warranty deed shall supersede and render of no future effect any quitclaim deed to the property executed by HHS and the Corporation.

Declares that this conveyance: (1) shall be made by warranty deed; and (2) shall not require any consideration from the Corporation for the property, impose any obligation, term, or condition on the Corporation, or allow for any U.S. reversionary interest in the property. Shields the Corporation from being liable for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination (including oil or petroleum products, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, pollutants, toxic substances, solid waste, or any other environmental contamination or hazard under any federal or Alaska law).

Accords to HHS any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability.

Requires the HHS to be in compliance with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 respecting certain deeds for the transfer of U.S. owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, disposed of, or known to have been released.</summary>
