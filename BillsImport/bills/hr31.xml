  <summary>1/14/2015--Introduced.
Condemns the terrorist attacks and murders at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo and the kosher market Hyper Cacher in Paris.

Expresses: (1) condolences to the families of the victims and to the Republic of France; and (2) solidarity with the people of the Republic of France, and pays tribute to our shared values, ideals, and liberties, including the freedom of thought and expression and freedom of the press.

Recognizes the statements from Muslim majority nations and leaders across the world that terrorist attacks purportedly conducted in Islam's name, such as the Paris attacks, are an affront to the Muslim faith.

Reaffirms the support of the House of Representatives for the government of France to bring the perpetrators of this violence to justice and to prevent future attacks.</summary>
