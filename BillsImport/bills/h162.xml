Amends the Truth in Lending Act to modify the exclusion from the definition of "mortgage originator" of a seller providing mortgage financing of three properties in a 12-month period to remove the requirement that a residential mortgage loan be fully amortizing. (Allows treatment as a mortgage originator of any seller providing mortgage financing of three properties in a 12-month period even if the mortgage loan involved is not fully amortizing.)</summary>
