Tenant Income Verification Relief Act of 2015

 Amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to annual review of low-income families' income for eligibility requirements for certain federal assisted housing programs.

Prohibits, after the initial review of any family's fix income, the public housing agency (PHA) or owner from being required to review its income for any year for which the family certifies, in accordance with specified requirements as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall establish.

 Requires the PHA or owner to review each such family's income at least once every three years.

Requires PHAs to also review a family's income receiving Section 8 (rental assistance voucher program) at least once every three years (currently, at least annually).</summary>
