Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to publish a report every six months listing countries that have: (1) refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation of an alien who is a national of that country, and the total number of such aliens; and (2) an excessive repatriation failure rate.

Directs the Secretary of State	with respect to a listed country: (1) to not issue visas to attendants, servants, and personal employees of such country's diplomats and officials/employees; and (2) reduce the number of visas available for such country's diplomats and officials/employees by 10% for each six months that a country is listed.

Authorizes the Secretary of DHS to exempt a country from inclusion if the total number of nonrepatriations outstanding is less than 10% for the preceding 3-year period.</summary>
