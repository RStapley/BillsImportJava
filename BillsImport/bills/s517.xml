Secure Rural Schools and Payment in Lieu of Taxes Repair Act 

This bill extends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Program through FY2016 at FY2011 funding levels. This Program provides payments to state jurisdictions to compensate for the cost of providing services in tax-exempt federal lands within such jurisdictions.

The bill also eliminates the fiscal year limitation on funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. This program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.</summary>
