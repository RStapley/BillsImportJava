  <summary>4/16/2015--Introduced.
Requires the Office of Science of the Department of Energy (DOE) to: (1) carry out a research program, and support relevant facilities, to discover various forms of nuclear matter; and (2) continue supporting the construction of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams.

Repeals provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requiring DOE to construct and operate a Rare Isotope Accelerator.

Directs the Office of Science to carry out a program for the production of isotopes that are determined to be necessary for research and applications, including the development of techniques to produce isotopes and support for infrastructure required for isotope research and production. Requires DOE to ensure that such isotope production activities do not compete with private industry unless critical national interests necessitate the federal government's involvement.</summary>
