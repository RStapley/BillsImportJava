Income Equity Act of 2015

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) deny employers a tax deduction for payments of excessive compensation to any full-time employee (i.e., compensation for services exceeding the greater of 25 times the median compensation paid to full-time employees during such taxable year or $500,000); and (2) require such employers to file a report with the Secretary of the Treasury on excessive compensation (as defined by this Act) paid to their employees. Defines "compensation" to include wages, salary, deferred compensation, retirement contributions, options, bonuses, property, and any other form of compensation that the Secretary determines is appropriate.</summary>
