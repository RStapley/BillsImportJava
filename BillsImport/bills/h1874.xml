Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act or the SKILLs Act

Amends title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize appropriations for FY2016-FY2021 for the Improving Literacy through School Libraries grant program.

Requires local educational agencies (LEAs) that receive school improvement funds to ensure, to the extent feasible, that each of their schools receiving such funds employs at least one state certified school library media specialist.

Directs states and LEAs that receive school improvement funds to ensure that by the beginning of the 2016-2017 school year there is at least one highly qualified school library media specialist in every school that receives such funds.

Requires Improving Literacy through School Libraries funds to be: (1) proportionally distributed to serve students in elementary, middle, and high schools; (2) used for media resources appropriate for all grades; and (3) used for professional development in information literacy instruction that is appropriate for all grades.

Expands the program of grants to states and subgrants to LEAs for the recruitment, retention, and professional development of teachers to require that highly qualified school library media specialists be included in the focus of such efforts.</summary>
