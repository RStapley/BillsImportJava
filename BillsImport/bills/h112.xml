  <summary>1/6/2015--Introduced.
This bill restores a 10-year statute of limitations for the collection of debts by administrative offset. An administrative offset is the withholding of funds payable by or held by the United States to satisfy a debt, and this bill prohibits the procedure from being used for claims that have been outstanding for more than 10 years.

The bill prohibits the Social Security Administration from seeking an administrative offset for collection of a debt or claim arising out of a Social Security benefit payment from a beneficiary's child who is without fault or from an individual who was under the age of 18 when the debt or claim arose.</summary>
