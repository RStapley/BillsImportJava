  <summary>2/5/2015--Introduced.
Acre In, Acre Out Act

 Prescribes a new requirement for any acquisition of land by the Department of the Interior or the Department of Agriculture that would result in a net increase of total land acreage under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service. Requires the department concerned to offer for sale an equal number of acres of federal land that is under the same jurisdictional status.

Exempts from this requirement any easements acquired to facilitate management of federal lands.

Requires land sold pursuant to this Act to be offered for sale at fair market value (based on local comparable sales), with monthly price reductions if the land is not sold in six months.

 Requires all net proceeds from the sale of federal lands pursuant to this Act to be deposited directly into the Treasury for reduction of the public debt.</summary>
