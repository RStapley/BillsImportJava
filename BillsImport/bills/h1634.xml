  <summary>3/25/2015--Introduced.
Border Security Technology Accountability Act of 2015

Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require each border security technology acquisition program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with a significant lifecycle cost estimate to: (1) have written documentation demonstrating that each such program has an acquisition program baseline approved by the relevant acquisition decision authority; and (2) demonstrate that each such program is meeting agreed-upon cost, schedule, and performance thresholds, in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

Directs: (1) the Under Secretary for Management, in coordination with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to ensure that border security technology acquisition program managers adhere to relevant internal control standards identified by the Comptroller General; and (2) the Commissioner to provide information to assist the Under Secretary in monitoring proper program management of such acquisition programs.

Requires the Under Secretary, in coordination with the Commissioner, to submit a plan for testing and evaluation, as well as the use of independent verification and validation resources, for border security technology so that new border security technologies are evaluated through a series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.</summary>
