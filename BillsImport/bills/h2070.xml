Vested Employee Pension Benefit Protection Act

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow employees in the building and construction industry to make distributions from their tax-exempt multi-employer pension plan at age 55 if they are not separated from employment at the time of such distributions and were participants in such plan on or before April 30, 2013, and the plan provides for payment of separate accrued benefits when the employee attains the plan's normal retirement age. Suspends payment of distributions for such building and construction industry employees if their multi-employer plan is in endangered or critical status.</summary>
