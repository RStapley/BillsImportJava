This bill requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to withdraw:

 the proposed HUD rule entitled "Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH)," any final rule based on it (including the rule with the Regulation Identifier Number RIN 2501-AD33), and any successor rule that is substantially similar to them; and the HUD notice relating to the AFFH Assessment Tool, any proposed or final rule issued pursuant to such notice, and any successor notice or rule substantially similar to them. HUD is required to consult with state, local government, and public housing agency officials to develop recommendations, consistent with applicable rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court, to further the Fair Housing Act's purposes and policies.</summary>
