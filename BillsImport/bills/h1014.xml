Marijuana Tax Revenue Act of 2015 

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose an excise tax on: (1) the sale of marijuana by producers or importers, and (2) each person who is engaged in a marijuana enterprise. Defines "marijuana enterprise" to mean a producer, importer, manufacturer, distributor, retailer or any person who transports, stores, displays, or otherwise participates in any business activity that handles marijuana or marijuana products.

Any person who engages in a marijuana enterprise must obtain a permit to engage in such an enterprise.

The bill imposes civil penalties for failure to comply with the requirements of this Act and criminal penalties for engaging in a marijuana enterprise without a permit, failing to keep or make required records or for making false records, or refusing to pay or evading a tax imposed by this Act and for other offenses related to the sale of marijuana.</summary>
