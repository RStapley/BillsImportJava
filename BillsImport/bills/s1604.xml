Transition to Independence Act

This bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a demonstration program over five fiscal years, beginning with FY2017, under which a Medicaid Buy-In-State meeting certain criteria may receive bonus payments for:

 meeting specific measurable benchmarks in expanding individual integrated employment and reducing subminimum wage work, congregate setting work, or facility-based day habilitation placements for working-age individuals with a disability receiving Medicaid-funded home or community-based services; and taking other actions conducive to expanding employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities within the state.</summary>
