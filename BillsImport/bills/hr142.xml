  <summary>3/4/2015--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the United States should rapidly transition to a sustainable, secure water economy that prioritizes ecological flows; (2) all federal agencies whose missions include water should coordinate their efforts and collaborate with state and local water authorities; and (3) the United States should prioritize the assessment of the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources and produce a national water census to address the inevitable challenges of Peak Water.</summary>
