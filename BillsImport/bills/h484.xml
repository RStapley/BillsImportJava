  <summary>1/22/2015--Introduced.
Duplication Elimination Act of 2015

This bill requires the President to send Congress a proposed joint resolution and a special message within 90 days of publication of the annual Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on duplicative government programs.

The joint resolution is limited to one that: (1) makes legislative changes needed to carry out the recommendations contained in the GAO report and included by the President, and (2) requires savings from the legislative changes to be transferred to the Treasury for deficit reduction.

The bill requires the special message to specify:

 the GAO recommendations that are excluded from the proposed joint resolution, why the recommendations were excluded, and the GAO recommendations included in the joint resolution. The bill sets forth expedited procedures for congressional consideration of the joint resolution.</summary>
