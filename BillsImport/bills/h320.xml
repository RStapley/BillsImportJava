  <summary>1/13/2015--Introduced.
Rapid DNA Act of 2015

Amends the DNA Identification Act of 1994 to require:

 the advisory board on DNA quality assurance methods appointed by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to include members from federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; such board to develop, and the Director to issue, standards for testing the proficiency of qualified agencies (i.e., booking stations, jails, prisons, detention centers, other law enforcement organizations and facilities outside of forensic laboratories) and operators in conducting analyses of DNA samples using sample-to-answer DNA analysis systems (i.e., fully automated systems that prepare and analyze DNA samples with no operator intervention); the National Institute of Justice to certify that the blind external proficiency testing program for DNA analyses has been established and made available to such qualified agencies or is not feasible; and the Index to facilitate law enforcement exchange of DNA identification information to include information on DNA identification records and DNA analyses prepared by such qualified agencies that are engaged in the intake, processing, booking, detention, or incarceration of individuals charged or convicted of qualifying offenses and that conduct the analysis of DNA samples on a sample-to-answer DNA analysis system.</summary>
