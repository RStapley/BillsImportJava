Wireless Telecommunications Tax and Fee Collection Fairness Act of 2015

Prohibits a state or&#160;local jurisdiction&#160;from requiring any person&#160;to&#160;collect from, or remit on behalf of, any other person any state or local fee, tax, or surcharge imposed on a purchaser or user with respect to the purchase or use of any wireless communication service within a state, unless there is a financial transaction between the person from whom the state seeks to require such collection or remittance and the purchaser or user of such service. Defines "financial transaction"&#160;to mean that there is a transaction involving cash, credit or any other exchange of monetary value or consideration given by the purchaser or user upon whom the fee, tax or surcharge is imposed to the person required to collect or remit the fee, tax or surcharge.</summary>
