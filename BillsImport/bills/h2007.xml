 Directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish an aerotropolis grant program to assist in the development of aerotropolis transportation systems (i.e., planned and coordinated multimodal freight and passenger transportation networks that provide efficient, sustainable, and intermodal connectivity to a defined region of economic significance centered around a major airport). Authorizes the Secretary to make grants to eligible entities to assist in planning, design, environmental review, or land acquisition activities for one or more specified kinds of projects to benefit such systems.</summary>
