  <summary>3/10/2015--Introduced.
Homeowners' Defense Act of 2015

 Establishes the National Catastrophe Risk Consortium, as a non-federal, non-profit entity, to ensure the availability and affordability of homeowners' insurance coverage for catastrophic events.

Directs the Consortium to: (1) maintain an inventory of catastrophe risk obligations held by state reinsurance funds, state residual insurance market entities, and state-sponsored providers of natural catastrophe insurance; (2) issue, on a conduit basis, securities and other financial instruments linked to catastrophe risks insured or reinsured through Consortium members; (3) coordinate reinsurance contracts; (4) act as a centralized repository of state risk information accessible by certain private-market participants; and (5) establish a database to perform research and analysis that encourages standardization of the risk-linked securities market.

 Shields the federal government and the Consortium from liability for Consortium actions.</summary>
