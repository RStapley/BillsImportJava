Honoring Our Trust Relationships Act of 2015 or the HOT-R Act 

This bill amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to exempt specified American Indian and Alaska Native programs administered by the Departments of the Interior, Education, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and Health and Human Services from sequestration. Sequestration is a process of automatic, usually across-the-board spending reductions under which budgetary resources are permanently cancelled to enforce specific budget policy goals.</summary>
