Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act 

 (Sec. 2) Prescribes certain whistleblower incentives and protections for motor vehicle manufacturer, part supplier, or dealership employees or contractors who voluntarily provide the Secretary of Transportation information relating to any motor vehicle defect, noncompliance, or any violation of any notification or reporting requirement which is likely to cause unreasonable risk of death or serious physical injury.

Authorizes the Secretary to pay awards to one or more whistleblowers in an aggregate amount of up to 30% of total monetary sanctions collected pursuant to an administrative or judicial action resulting in aggregate monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million.

Denies an award to any whistleblower who:

 is convicted of a criminal violation related to such administrative or judicial action; contributes to the alleged violation of a requirement under this Act; submits to the Secretary information based on facts previously submitted by another whistleblower; fails to provide original information to the Secretary in the appropriate form; or fails to report or attempt to report the information internally to the motor vehicle manufacturer, parts supplier, or dealership, unless the whisltleblower reasonably believed it would have resulted in retaliation or was already known by the manufacturer, part supplier, or dealership. Prohibits also an award to any whistleblower who knowingly and willfully makes false representations. Subjects such a whistleblower to criminal penalties.

Requires nondisclosure of a whistleblower's identity, except in specified circumstances.

Authorizes a whistleblower to appeal Secretary determinations in the appropriate U.S. court of appeals.</summary>
