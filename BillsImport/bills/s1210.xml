  <summary>5/6/2015--Introduced.
Oil and Gas Production and Distribution Reform Act of 2015

This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to: (1) identify, as soon as practicable after an application for federal authorization is submitted, each federal, state, or local governmental entity that may consider an aspect of that application; and (2) invite each identified agency to cooperate or participate in the review process for the application.

The governmental entity delegated to review an aspect of the application must make a final decision on the aspect of the federal authorization under its consideration within 90 days after FERC issues its final environmental document (unless federal law establishes a different schedule).

 When deciding a federal authorization, an agency must defer to the scope of environmental review that FERC determines appropriate.

Each agency considering an application for federal authorization shall take certain actions as well as identify and, according to specified procedures, try to resolve issues that may delay or prevent granting of the authorization.</summary>
