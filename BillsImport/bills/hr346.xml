  <summary>6/25/2015--Introduced.
Condemns: (1) the Assad regime for its atrocities against the Syrian people, including its weaponized use of chlorine; and (2) the use of any toxic chemical, including chlorine, as a weapon in Syria.

 Maintains that: (1) those who have engaged in such unlawful actions should be held accountable by the international community and urges the President to report to Congress on the use of chemical weapons, including chlorine, in Syria; and (2) no party in Syria should use, develop, acquire, or transfer chemical weapons, including weapons employing chlorine.

Calls on the Administration to: (1) continue offering material support to programs and individuals collecting evidence of the use of chemical weapons inside of Syria, and (2) facilitate the future transfer of such evidence for use in prosecuting those responsible.

Urges the international community to establish a comprehensive strategy regarding Syria which may include establishing a no-fly zone in Syria.</summary>
