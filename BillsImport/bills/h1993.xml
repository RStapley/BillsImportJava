Flexibility to Farm Act 

This bill permits the chief executive of a state to create exemptions from federal environmental laws and regulations for farmers that are adversely affected by the requirements. The bill applies to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) and the requirements of the Clean Air Act that apply to emissions of air pollutants other than those resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels. Prior to finalizing any determination under this bill, the chief executive must solicit and accept public comments for at least 90 days.</summary>
