  <summary>4/27/2015--Introduced.
Anti-Swatting Act of 2015 

Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for enhanced penalties for the transmission of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to trigger a response by a law enforcement agency.

Directs the court to order a defendant who has been convicted of such an offense to reimburse any law enforcement agencies or any government agencies or private not-for-profit organizations that provide fire, rescue, or emergency medical services for expenses incurred in responding to such conduct. Treats such an order of reimbursement as a civil judgment.</summary>
