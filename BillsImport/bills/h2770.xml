Keeping our Travelers Safe and Secure Act

(Sec. 3) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) of the Department of Homeland Security to develop and implement a preventive maintenance validation process for security-related technology deployed to airports.

The maintenance contracts for security-related technology deployed to airports shall include penalties for noncompliance whenever preventive or corrective maintenance has not been completed according to contractual requirements and manufacturers' specifications.

(Sec. 4) The DHS Inspector General shall assess implementation of the requirements of this Act as well as the utilization of TSA equipment maintenance technicians, and make recommendations for training TSA personnel, equipment maintenance technicians, and other airport personnel.</summary>
