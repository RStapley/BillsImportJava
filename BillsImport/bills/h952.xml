Put a Registered Nurse in the Nursing Home Act of 2015

Amends titles XVIII (Medicare) and XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act with respect to coverage of nursing care services in skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities, respectively, to revise the standards for 24-hour licensed nursing service care which a professional registered nurse is required to provide at least eight consecutive hours a day, seven days a week.

Requires such facilities, instead, to use the services of at least one registered professional nurse to provide assessment, surveillance, and direct care to residents 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</summary>
