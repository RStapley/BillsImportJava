  <summary>1/27/2015--Introduced.
Pay Back the Taxpayers Act of 2015

 Prohibits the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (government sponsored enterprises or GSEs), after enactment of this Act and during the term of any conservatorship or receivership, from making any contribution or transfer to, or allocating or setting aside any amounts for, the Housing Trust Fund or the Capital Magnet Fund.

Requires any amounts set aside by a GSE, before enactment of this Act, for either Trust Fund but not yet allocated or transferred to it, not to be so allocated or transferred but to be covered into the General Fund of the Treasury and used only for reducing the federal budget deficit.

Requires any amounts paid or repaid to the Secretary of the Treasury by a GSE, in any form after enactment, and during any conservatorship or receivership of the GSE, to be covered into the General Fund and for the same purpose only.</summary>
