Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act

Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops, known collectively as the "Ghost Army," in recognition of its service during World War II.

Expresses the sense of the Congress that the Smithsonian Institution should make the medal available for display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations associated with the Ghost Army, and that preference should be given to locations affiliated with the Smithsonian.

Authorizes Treasury to strike and sell duplicates in bronze at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medal.</summary>
