Surviving Spouses' Benefit Improvement Act of 2015 

 Monthly rates are increased for veterans' dependency and indemnity compensation payable to surviving spouses through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Benefits under any other law (other than duplication of benefits) shall not be reduced or offset because the surviving spouse is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation.

 Six months after enactment of this Act, VA shall pay to an individual who is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation predicated on the death of a veteran before January 1, 1993, monthly dependency and indemnity compensation that is the greater of the amount in effect either before or after enactment of this Act.</summary>
