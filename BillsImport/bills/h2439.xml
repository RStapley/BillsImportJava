  <summary>5/19/2015--Introduced.
This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to revise the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service to: (1) remove the limit on the number of members, (2) expand eligibility for appointment, (3) set a maximum pay rate, and (4) remove the option for members to contribute to the retirement system of an institution of higher education.

The Department of Health and Human Services must report on the implementation of these amendments, including whether the amendments improved the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to hire and retain qualified experts to fulfill obligations under user fee agreements.</summary>
