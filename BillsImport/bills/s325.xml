  <summary>1/30/2015--Introduced.
All Year Schools Support Act

Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a multi-year pilot program awarding four grants to states, local educational agencies, or other public or private entities to establish or expand year-round education programs at public elementary or secondary schools.

Allows grantees to increase the salaries of teachers participating in the year-round education programs by not to exceed 100%.

Requires the Secretary to give priority to grant applicants that: (1) propose to carry out year-round education activities that emphasize science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and (2) target low-performing schools and areas with high populations of low-income individuals.</summary>
