  <summary>4/28/2015--Introduced.
This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to define "criminal gang."

An alien who is or was a member of a criminal gang, or who participated in gang activity knowing that such participation will promote the gang's illegal activity, is inadmissible and deportable.

The Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a group or association as a criminal gang.

Detention is mandatory for anyone found inadmissible or deportable for criminal street gang membership.

Individuals found inadmissible or deportable for criminal gang membership are barred from:

 asylum; withholding of removal; temporary protected status; special immigrant juvenile status; deferred action; and parole, unless assisting the United States in a law enforcement matter and required by the government to be present with respect to such assistance. An alien found at a U.S. land border or port of entry who is determined to be inadmissible and a threat to public safety (certain criminals, terrorists, street gang members) shall be subject to expedited removal.</summary>
