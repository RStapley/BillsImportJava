No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act 

This bill prohibits any federal officer or employer&#160;from extending an offer of employment in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to any individual until the IRS publicly issues a written certification that the IRS does not employ any individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt.

A seriously delinquent tax debt is an outstanding tax debt for which the IRS has filed a notice of lien in public records, excluding a tax debt: (1) that is being paid in a timely manner under an approved installment payment agreement or an offer-in-compromise, (2) for which a collection due process hearing has been requested or is pending, (3) for which a tax levy has been issued, or (4) with respect to which relief has been granted due to economic hardship.</summary>
