To Help Reduce Inefficient Federal Tendencies Act of 2015 or&#160;the THRIFT Act of 2015

Allows federal agencies, including judicial branch agencies, to: (1) retain up to 25% of annual savings from the implementation of plans developed by such agencies to create efficiencies and cost savings in agency operations; and (2) use such savings for specified purposes, including salary increases and employee awards for cost savings disclosures. Requires an agency to&#160;submit to the appropriate congressional committees a plan and an associated request to amend its approved operating budget specifying how such savings will be achieved and the amount and source of such savings.</summary>
