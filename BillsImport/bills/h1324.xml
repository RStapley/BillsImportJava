(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)

Arapaho National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 2015

Adjusts the boundary of the Arapaho National Forest in Colorado to incorporate approximately 92.95 acres of specified land. Requires the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to include all federal land within such boundary in the Bowen Gulch Protection Area established under the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993.

Declares that nothing in this Act opens privately owned lands within the boundary to public motorized use or denies motorized access through boundary lands for owners of any non-federal lands within the boundary who historically have had such access.</summary>
