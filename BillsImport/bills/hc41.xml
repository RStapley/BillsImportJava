  <summary>4/23/2015--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) U.S. citizens and residents have the Constitutional right to record law enforcement officers in a public place and shall be required to give up possession of a recording device used to do so based only upon the individual's consent or a warrant based on probable cause; (2) law enforcement officers shall safeguard data stored on any recording device seized from an individual and the destruction of such data is a violation of federal law; and (3) no data stored on a recording device seized from an individual may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding unless collected pursuant to a warrant based on probable cause or where an exception to the warrant requirement applies.</summary>
