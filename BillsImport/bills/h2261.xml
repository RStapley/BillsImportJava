Commercial Remote Sensing Act of 2015

This bill directs the Department of Commerce to report annually to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on: (1) the implementation of its authority to license private entities to operate private remote sensing space systems; (2) all notifications and information provided to Commerce by licensees; and (3) all administrative actions taken to adjust penalties for violations of licensing requirements, issue subpoenas, and seize by warrant material necessary to investigate violations of licensing requirements.

Commerce must also report to such Committees on statutory updates necessary to protect national security, protect the U.S. industrial base, and reflect the current state of the art of remote sensing systems, instruments, or technologies.</summary>
