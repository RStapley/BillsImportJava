  <summary>2/13/2015--Introduced.
Energy Freedom and Economic Prosperity Act 

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal: (1) the excise tax credits for alcohol fuel, biodiesel, and alternative fuel mixtures; (2) the tax credits for the purchase of alternative motor vehicles and new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles; (3) the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property tax credit; (4) the income tax credits for alcohol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel used as fuel; (5) the enhanced oil recovery tax credit and the tax credit for producing oil and gas from marginal wells; (6) the tax credits for producing electricity from renewable resources and from advanced nuclear power facilities; (7) the tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration; (8) the energy tax credit; and (9) the tax credits for investment in qualifying advanced coal projects and qualifying gasification projects.

Directs the Department of the Treasury to prescribe a flat income tax rate for corporations, in lieu of the existing marginal tax rates, based upon the overall revenue savings from the repeal of energy tax expenditures by this Act.</summary>
