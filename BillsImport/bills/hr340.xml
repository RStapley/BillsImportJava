  <summary>6/25/2015--Passed House without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Returns to the Senate H.R. 1735 (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016) with the Senate amendment because, in the opinion of the House of Representatives, the Senate amendment contravenes the clause of the Constitution requiring bills raising revenue to originate in the House and is an infringement of the privileges of the House.</summary>
