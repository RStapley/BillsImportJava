  <summary>2/5/2015--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a state, on behalf of a local government, to submit to the Secretary of the Treasury notice of a past-due, legally enforceable local tax obligation for offset against a taxpayer's tax refund. Defines "past-due, legally enforceable local tax obligation" as any debt which: (1) resulted from a judgment determining an amount of tax due to a local government; (2) is no longer subject to judicial review; or (3) resulted from a tax imposed by a local government which has been assessed but not collected, the time for redetermination of which has expired, and which has not been delinquent for more than 10 years.</summary>
