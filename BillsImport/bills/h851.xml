  <summary>2/10/2015--Introduced.
Amends part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to eliminate the current reservation of 1% of the school improvement funds for outlying areas and Indian education. Reserves .67% of the school improvement funds for Indian education, but raises that reservation to .75% beginning with the fiscal year the allocations to states equal or surpass FY2015 levels after subtracting .75% of those allocations for Indian education.

Establishes formulae for determining the minimum allotment to American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands of school improvement funds for: (1) basic grants to local educational agencies (LEAs), (2) concentration grants to LEAs, (3) targeted grants to LEAs, and (4) grants under the education finance incentive grant program.</summary>
