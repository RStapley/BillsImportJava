Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to extend through FY2020 the authorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.

(Sec. 3) Requires the transfer to the Treasury, no later than January 31, 2023, of all funds appropriated for such Program for FY2016-FY2020 that are not obligated on or before December 31, 2022.

(Sec. 4) Expresses the sense of Congress that amounts made available to carry out such Program should be made available through the end of the fiscal year following the one for which the amounts are appropriated and should not be made available until expended.

(Sec. 5) Prohibits a state, local government, or Indian tribe from using any funding under another grant program to pay or defer the cost of the matching fund requirement for such Program.

(Sec. 6) Requires a grantee under such Act that uses funds to purchase an armor vest or body armor to comply with any requirements for the use of Program grants, to have a written policy requiring uniformed patrol officers to wear an armor vest or body armor, and to use the funds to purchase vests or body armor that meet performance standards established by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.

(Sec. 7) Allows preferential consideration in Program grant awards to jurisdictions that provide armor vests to law enforcement officers that are uniquely fitted for such officers, including individual female officers.</summary>
