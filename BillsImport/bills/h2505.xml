Medicare Advantage Coverage Transparency Act of 2015

Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (in effect, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) to report to specified congressional committees by May 1 of each year on enrollment data for all Medicare programs (including on individuals receiving benefits under Medicare part A [Hospital Insurance]) for the plan year or, in the case of enrollment under both part A and part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance), for the fiscal year or year (as applicable), ending before January 1.

The report must also cover enrollment under a MedicareAdvantage plan under part C (Medicare+Choice Program) and enrollment under part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program).

If HHS is unable to submit such a report by May 1 of any year it shall notify those committees of the inability by April 30, with an explanation and the date by which the report will be made, which shall be not later than June 1.</summary>
