  <summary>2/3/2015--Introduced.
21st Century Classroom Innovation Act

Amends part A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) of title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to allow states to use up to 5% of their part A grant funds that are reserved for allocating subgrants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to award competitive grants to LEAs, charter schools, or consortia of such entities to carry out blended learning projects.

Defines a "blended learning project" as a formal education program that: (1) includes an element of online learning and instructional time in a supervised location away from home; (2) includes an element of student control over time, path, or pace; and (3) connects the elements of the education program to provide an integrated learning experience.

Requires the competitive grant funds to be used for: (1) planning activities, the purchase of digital instructional resources, initial professional development activities, and one-time information technology purchases; or (2) ongoing professional development for teachers, school leaders, or other personnel involved in the project.

Requires each state making such a grant to contribute non-federal funds equal to at least 10% of the grant.</summary>
