  <summary>5/21/2015--Introduced.
Condemns China's unilateral construction of artificial land formations in the disputed Spratly Islands.

Urges all parties to maritime and territorial disputes in the region to respect the status quo, exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would undermine stability or escalate disputes, refrain from inhabiting or garrisoning presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, and other features, and refrain from unilateral actions that cause permanent physical change to the marine environment pending final delimitation.

Urges China to clarify: (1) the meaning of its "nine dash line" claim and the maritime areas it claims within that space, and (2) its intentions with respect to establishing "necessary military defense" on reclaimed features.

Reaffirms U.S. support for the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as they seek to develop a code of conduct of parties in the South China Sea with China, and urges China to enter into such negotiations in a serious manner.

Supports: (1) efforts to strengthen regional maritime domain awareness; (2) efforts to strengthen maritime partner capacity, including through the sale and transfer of technology that promotes maritime domain awareness; and (3) continuation of U.S. Armed Forces operations in support of freedom of navigation rights in international waters and air space in the South China Sea.</summary>
