Collection and Analysis of Data to Educate and Train Law Enforcement Officers Act of 2015 or the CADET Act

Requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation to revise the Uniform Crime Reports and the National Incident-Based Reporting System to include information pertaining to the justified and unjustified uses of force resulting in death or injury by or against law enforcement officers, including: (1) the age, race, gender, religion, and criminal history of the victim; and (2) the age, race, gender, and other relevant information relating to the officer involved, such as the number of prior officer involved shootings and uses of lethal force, the number and disposition of citizen complaints filed against the officer, and the nature and description of any disciplinary actions taken against the officer.

Directs the Attorney General to reduce by between 10% and 25% the amount that would otherwise be awarded under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to a state or local government that fails to provide such information.</summary>
