  <summary>4/14/2015--Introduced.
Congress disapproves the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving Section 3(a) of the Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014 (D.C. Act 20-605), signed by the Mayor of the District on January 25, 2015, and transmitted on March 6, 2015, to Congress pursuant to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.

Section 3(a) repeals the exemption allowing religiously-affiliated educational institutions to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

D.C. Act 20-605:

 amends the Office of Human Rights Establishment Act of 1999 to require the Director of the Office of Human Rights to have a demonstrated professional background in human rights law, amends the Human Rights Act of 1977 (HRA of 1977) to require the annual report by the Mayor to the District Council to include information on investigations and inquiries undertaken by the Director or the Office, repeals the exemption allowing religiously-affiliated educational institutions to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, and makes inapplicable to HRA of 1977 claims that required specified written notice to the Mayor regarding claims against the District for unliquidated damages.</summary>
