Hold Congress Accountable Act

 Requires a reduction in the annual rate of pay of a Member of Congress during a government shutdown equal to the product of 1 day's worth of pay under such annual rate and the number of 24-hour periods during which the government shutdown is in effect. Makes such reduction applicable to days occurring after the date of the general election for federal office held in November 2016.

Requires any amount of pay of a Member of Congress in the 114th Congress that is reduced due to a government shutdown to be held in escrow until the last day of the 114th Congress and released for payment to Members at that time.</summary>
