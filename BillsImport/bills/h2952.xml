Improving Employment Outcomes of TANF Recipients

This bill amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act to replace the current program of bonus grants for high performing states with a program requiring the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to make a grant to a state for each fiscal year that it achieves a requisite level of performance, under an agreement with HHS, indicated by the percentage of former TANF recipients who are in unsubsidized employment after exiting the TANF program.</summary>
