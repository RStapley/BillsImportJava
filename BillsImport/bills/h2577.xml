Highlights: 

The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 provides FY2016 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and several related agencies.

The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). Funding from the HTF is contingent on the enactment of a new authorization bill.

The bill increases overall funding for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies above FY2015 levels. Compared to FY2015 levels, the bill decreases funding for DOT and increases funding for HUD.

Within the DOT budget, the bill:

 decreases funding for National Infrastructure Investments (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery or TIGER grants), the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), Capital Investment Grants (New Starts), and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority; increases funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Maritime Administration, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration; and funds the Federal-Aid Highway Program from the HTF at the FY2015 level, contingent on the enactment of a new authorization bill. Within the HUD budget, the bill:

 increases funding for the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance and Project-Based Rental Assistance accounts that fund the low-income housing programs under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; decreases funding for Policy Development and Research, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, and the Information Technology Fund; and funds the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) formula program and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program at the FY2015 levels. For Public Housing, the bill funds the Public Housing Operating Fund at the FY2015 level and decreases funding for the Public Housing Capital Fund and Choice Neighborhoods.

The bill decreases funding for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation.

Also included in the bill are provisions that would:

 restrict flights and cruise ships from traveling to Cuba, prohibit the use of funds for high-speed rail in California, limit the authority of the Surface Transportation Board to approve phases of the California High Speed Rail project, affect limits on truck size and weight, restrict enforcement of regulations for commercial truck drivers' rest, and prohibit funding for a rule modifying requirements and processes HUD program participants use to reduce housing discrimination.
