  <summary>6/18/2015--Introduced.
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission opened the door to the corrupting influence of money in politics, (2) Congress should have the power to regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind equivalents with respect to federal elections, and (3) all political contributions should be publicly disclosed so that voters have complete information about who is paying for political advertisements.</summary>
