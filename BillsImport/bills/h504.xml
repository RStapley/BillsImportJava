Energy Star Program Integrity Act 

This bill amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to revise the Energy Star program to prohibit a disclosure relating to participation of a product in the program from creating a warranty or giving rise to private claims or rights of action relating to disqualification of the product from Energy Star if: (1) the product has been certified by a certification body recognized by the program, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved corrective measures, and (3) the responsible party has fully complied with all such measures.

The bill may not be construed to require the EPA to modify any procedure or take any other action.</summary>
