  <summary>4/30/2015--Introduced.
Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act of 2015

Grants covered federal law enforcement officers the same rights to carry a government-issued firearm during a covered furlough as they had before such furlough was in effect.

Defines: (1) "covered federal law enforcement officer" to mean any agency employee who has the authority to make arrests or apprehensions for or prosecute violations of federal law and who, on the day before the applicable covered furlough begins, is authorized by the agency to carry a firearm in the course of official duties; and (2) "covered furlough" to mean a planned event by an agency during which employees are involuntarily furloughed due to downsizing, reduced funding, lack of work, or any budget situation, including a lapse in appropriations.</summary>
