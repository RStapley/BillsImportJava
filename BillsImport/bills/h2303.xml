Pathogen Reduction and Testing Reform Act of 2015

This bill amends the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act to revise the definition of "adulterated" to make explicit the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) authority to issue a recall of meat, poultry, and egg products that contain microbial pathogens associated with serious illness or death or are resistant to two or more antibiotics critically important for human medicine.

The bill requires USDA to establish sampling protocols and testing procedures necessary to determine if meat, poultry, and egg products are adulterated under this bill and to prevent the entry, flow, or movement of those products into commerce.</summary>
