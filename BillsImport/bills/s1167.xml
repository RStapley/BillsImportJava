Owyhee Wilderness Areas Boundary Modifications Act 

Adjusts the boundaries of the North Fork Owyhee Wilderness, the Owyhee River Wilderness, and the Pole Creek Wilderness in Idaho to exclude certain land.

Amends the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 to allow motor vehicles to continue to be used for livestock monitoring, herding, and gathering in the Big Jacks Creek Wilderness, Bruneau-Jarbidge Rivers Wilderness, Little Jacks Creek Wilderness, North Fork Owyhee Wilderness, Owyhee River Wilderness, and Pole Creek Wilderness.

Requires the Department of the Interior to: (1) report to Congress on all livestock grazing management activities that were authorized in such wilderness areas on the day before they were designated as wilderness, and (2) use the report to assist in the management of livestock grazing in those areas.</summary>
