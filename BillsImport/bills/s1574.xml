Older Americans Community Access Revitalization and Education Act or the CARE Act

Amends the Older Americans Act of 1965 to direct the Administration on Aging (AoA) of the Administration for Community Living of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a community care wrap-around support demonstration program of grants to enable eligible entities to: (1) establish community care wrap-around support partnerships; and (2) carry out specified activities, including longitudinal care plans for each eligible older individual as well as medication management and medical nutrition therapy.

Directs the AoA to provide funding through area agencies on aging, and other approved entities, to not-for-profit owners or managers of housing for a pilot project service packaged and targeted for residents of federally assisted housing.

Directs the AoA, through a coordinated public education and outreach campaign carried out by the National Eldercare Locator Service, and in coordination with other appropriate federal agencies, to promote: (1) enhanced public awareness of the importance of advance planning for integrated long-term care; and (2) the availability of national, state, and local information and resources to assist in such planning, as well as the existence of area agencies and aging service providers to give direct assistance with it.</summary>
