Put School Counselors Where They're Needed Act

This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Department of Education to implement a demonstration project providing competitive, 4-year grants to at least 10 secondary schools that have a 4-year adjusted cohort graduation rate of 60% or lower, for the provision of additional school counselors and counselor resources.

The bill expresses the sense of Congress that grantees should provide one additional counselor for every 250 students at risk.

The additional school counselors must serve primarily students identified as being at risk of not graduating in four years.

Grantees that demonstrate progress in improving their graduation rates are eligible for subsequent grants.</summary>
