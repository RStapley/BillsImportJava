  <summary>4/28/2015--Introduced.
Ratepayer Protection Act of 2015 

This bill extends the deadline for mandatory compliance with final rules that target carbon dioxide emissions from existing sources that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units under the Clean Air Act, including any final rule that succeeds either:

 the proposed rule entitled "Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units," or the supplemental proposed rule entitled "Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: EGUs in Indian Country and U.S. Territories; Multi-Jurisdictional Partnerships". The extension period begins 60 days after the notice of promulgation of a final rule appears in the Federal Register and ends following any judicial review, on the date a judgment becomes final, and no longer subject to further appeal or review, in all actions (including those under the Clean Air Act) that are filed during that 60-day period.

A state is also shielded under the bill from:

 being required to adopt or submit a state plan, and being subject to a federal plan under any federal final rule if the governor notifies the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency that implementation of either plan would have a significant adverse effect upon: (1) the state's residential, commercial, or industrial ratepayers; or (2) upon the reliability of the state's electricity system.</summary>
