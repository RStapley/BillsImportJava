  <summary>2/3/2015--Introduced.
Teach Safe Relationships Act of 2015

Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to authorize the Secretary of Education to award competitive four-year grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide: (1) professional development to school administrators, teachers, and staff in safe relationship behavior education; and (2) educational programming and curricula for students regarding safe relationship behavior.

Defines "safe relationship behavior education" as education that:

 is medically accurate and appropriate for an individual's age, developmental stage, and culture; promotes safe relationships and teaches students to recognize and prevent coercion, violence, or abuse, including physical and emotional relationship abuse; includes education regarding relationship communication skills, emotional health, accountability, and well-being in relationships, and consent; and includes education regarding healthy relationships. Directs the Secretary to provide LEAs with policy guidance regarding safe relationship behavior training and the promotion of safe and healthy relationships.

Prohibits the use of ESEA funds for sex or HIV-prevention education in schools if that instruction does not include safe relationship behavior education. (Currently, sex or HIV-prevention education in schools must be age appropriate and include the health benefits of abstinence.)</summary>
