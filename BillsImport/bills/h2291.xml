Rural Veterans Travel Enhancement Act of 2015

Makes permanent the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to transport individuals to and from VA facilities in connection with vocational rehabilitation, counseling, examination, treatment, or care.

Treats Vet Centers (centers for readjustment counseling and related mental health services for veterans) as VA facilities for purposes of providing payment of actual expenses of travel or allowance for travel to or from a VA facility.

Amends the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 to reauthorize through FY2020 a grant program to provide innovative transportation options to veterans in highly rural areas.</summary>
