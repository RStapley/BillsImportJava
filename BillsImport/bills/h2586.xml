Export Coordination Act of 2015

 Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to revise the duties of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC).

Requires the TPCC to:

 identify opportunities to consolidate or co-locate offices of federal agencies involved in export promotion and export financing activities; assess the use and coordination of electronic databases among federal agencies in support of such activities; and provide a detailed listing of current and future federal and state-led trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities to ensure better delivery of services to U.S. businesses. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to make available information on federal and state-led trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities on the Export.gov website.

Requires the governmentwide strategic plan for federal trade promotion efforts to:

 clearly identify and explain the role, goals, and objectives of each TPCC member agency with respect its export promotion and export financing activities; include the recommendations of the Comptroller General relating to coordination of the TPCC and member agencies; and reflect the recommendations of the U.S. Travel Association (currently, U.S. National Tourism Organization) to the degree considered appropriate by the TPCC. Directs the TPCC to establish a working group to advise it on matters relating to state trade promotion.

Revises membership of the TPCC to include representatives from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, as well as one ex officio, nonvoting presidential appointee representing a state trade promotion agency and who is a member of the working group.

Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Commerce to report biennially to Congress on the extent to which the TPCC is successfully carrying out its duties.</summary>
