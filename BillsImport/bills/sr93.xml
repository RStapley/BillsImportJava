  <summary>3/10/2015--Passed Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Recognizes the courageous work of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemstov who dedicated his life to the fight against corruption and in support of the rights of the Russian people to freely choose their leaders and live according to democratic standards.

 Calls for an investigation into his murder using mechanisms from either the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or the Council of Europe.

Urges the President to: (1) add the names of persons that Mr. Nemtsov requested be added to the visa ban list as provided for by the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, and (2) continue to sanction human rights violators.

Encourages the President to send a high level U.S. delegation to Mr. Nemtsov's funeral service.

Calls on the President to increase U.S. support for like-minded partners in the Russian Federation and the region to combat the flow of propaganda and the climate of hatred created by President Putin.</summary>
