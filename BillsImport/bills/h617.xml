  <summary>1/28/2015--Introduced.
Clinical Trial Cancer Mission 2020 Act

Amends the Public Health Service Act to revise clinical trial registry data bank provisions to specify that a device or drug clinical trial must be included in the clinical trial registry data bank regardless of whether it results in a positive or negative outcome.

Requires the responsible party of any clinical trials funded in whole or in part by the Department of Defense (DOD) to certify in all required grant or progress forms that the required submissions to the clinical trial registry data bank have been made. Requires DOD to verify that the clinical trial information has been submitted before releasing any remaining grant funds or funding future grants.

Makes a clinical trial grantee of the Department of Health and Human Services or DOD who fails to submit the required information to the data bank ineligible for the remaining grant funds or future funds. Makes the grantee liable for repayment of grant amounts already provided.</summary>
