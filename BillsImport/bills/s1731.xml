Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act of 2015

 This bill eliminates the minimum continuous active duty service requirement for homeless veterans to receive certain benefits, including: (1) outreach, (2) rehabilitative services, (3) vocational counseling and training, (4) transitional housing assistance, (5) supportive services for very low-income veteran families in permanent housing, and (6) health care for homeless veterans with special needs.

Homeless veterans are exempted from disqualification for such benefits because of discharge or dismissal from the Armed Services under conditions other than honorable, except for discharge by reason of a general court-martial.

Veteran is defined for purposes of such benefits as a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, regardless of length of service, and who was discharged or released therefrom, except for a person who: (1) received a dishonorable discharge, or (2) was discharged or dismissed by reason of a general court-martial.

 VA shall conduct related training and education for appropriate VA and grant recipient personnel.</summary>
