  <summary>4/21/2015--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to meet our nation's growing long-term energy demands and maintain our economic viability in the world marketplace, any comprehensive and economically viable energy bill must address:

 taking advantage of our abundant domestic coal supply; using recent technological innovations to exploit our vast supply of natural gas; increasing our domestic oil production, infrastructure, and refining capacity; expanding the use of renewable and alternative energy sources; exploring and investing in advanced nuclear reactor technologies; reflecting the discoveries of light sweet crude in the United States and evaluating the capacity and market for extracting and refining it; providing incentives for an increase in conservation and energy efficiency; expanding research and development through new methods such as public-private partnerships; and enhancing consumer awareness and education regarding methods to increase energy efficiency and available alternative fuel sources to reduce America's dependence on Middle Eastern oil and provide energy security.</summary>
