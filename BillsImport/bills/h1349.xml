United States-Israel Anti-Tunnel Defense Cooperation Act

 This bill authorizes the President, upon request of the government of Israel, and acting through the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, to:

 carry out research, development, and test activities on a joint basis with Israel to establish an anti-tunneling defense system to detect, map, and destroy underground tunnels from Gaza to the territory of Israel or other countries that share a border with Gaza; and provide assistance to Israel for an anti-tunneling system. None of the funds authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act may be obligated or expended until the President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, makes specified certifications to Congress regarding:

 fund use by Israel, sharing of research and development costs, and the rights to any intellectual property developed under the cooperative research and development projects.</summary>
