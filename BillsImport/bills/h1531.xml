Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act

(Sec. 2) Makes an employee of specified&#160;land management agencies in the Department of the Interior serving under a time-limited, including a temporary,&#160;appointment in the competitive service eligible to compete for a permanent appointment in any land management agency or any other agency if: (1) the original appointment was competitive, (2) the employee has served under one or more time-limited appointments totaling more than 24 months without a break of two or more years, and (3) the employee's performance has been at an acceptable level.

Requires the Office of Personnel Management or other examining agency, in determining the eligibility of a time-limited employee to be examined for or appointed in the competitive service, to waive requirements as to age, unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position.

Provides that an individual appointed under the provisions of this Act becomes a career-conditional employee and acquires competitive status upon appointment.

Deems a former employee of a land management agency who served under a time-limited appointment and who otherwise meets applicable requirements to be a time-limited employee for purposes of this Act if: (1) such employee applies for a position covered by this Act within two years after the most recent date of separation, and (2) such employee's most recent separation was for reasons other than misconduct or performance.</summary>
