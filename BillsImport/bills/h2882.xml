Promise Neighborhoods Act of 2015

This bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive, matching Promise Neighborhood Partnership grants to nonprofit organizations that partner with a local educational agency to implement a comprehensive continuum of supports and services that engage community partners in improving the academic achievement, health and social development, and college and career readiness of children who live in distressed neighborhoods with underperforming schools.

ED may renew Promise Neighborhood Partnership grants if the grantees demonstrate significant success in: (1) ensuring children's school readiness; (2) improving their academic outcomes; (3) increasing their college and career readiness; and (4) improving their health, mental health, and social and emotional well-being.

ED must evaluate this Act's grant program and disseminate research on best practices for improving the academic achievement of children living in the most distressed communities.

Matching planning grants are available to enable communities to assess needs and assets and support the communities as they prepare to apply for a program grant.</summary>
