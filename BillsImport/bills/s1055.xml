This bill directs the General Services Administration and the Department of Energy to develop plans for meeting goals for deep energy retrofits in federal buildings by 2020, 2030, and 2040. A deep energy retrofit is a project carried out in a federal building that results in energy savings in that building of at least 35%, and preferably at least 50%, relative to a baseline rate of energy use.</summary>
