Requires the reports to include: (1) aggregate expenditures on the program; (2) a list of each payment made to a participating telecommunications&#160;carrier for the provision of service through the program, including, in the case of a participating carrier that is reimbursed for the provision of service to both wireless and wireline subscribers, the amount of the payment that corresponds to each type of service; and (3) the average cost per subscriber, across all the participating carriers, to provide the service that the program subsidizes, broken down by wireless and wireline subscribers and averaged per subscriber.</summary>
