Bolstering Our Nation's Deficient Structures Act of 2015 or the BONDS Act 

 Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to build America bonds,&#160;to: (1) make permanent the issuance authority for such bonds&#160;and the authority for payments to bond issuers, (2) make phased reductions in the credit percentage to bondholders and in the&#160;percentage of payments to issuers of such bonds, (3) make federal wage rate and other grant requirements applicable to such bonds, (4) allow refundings of currently-issued bonds, and (5) allow the use of such bonds to fund capital expenditures for levees and flood control projects.

Provides for an increase in payments to issuers of build America bonds to compensate for reductions in the amount of such payments due to sequestration.</summary>
