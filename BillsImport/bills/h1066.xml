Clinical Trials Modernization Act of 2015

This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow sponsors of applications for new drugs, biological products, and medical devices to propose incorporation of alternative statistical methods, including adaptive trial design and Bayesian methods, into clinical trial protocols and marketing applications.

The FDA is required to issue guidance that establishes or clarifies standards for using alternative statistical methods in clinical trials.

The FDA must establish a process under which a post-approval study or clinical trial required by the FDA is periodically evaluated to determine whether the trial or study is no longer scientifically warranted or whether the design should be renegotiated because of changes in medical practice or the standard of care.</summary>
