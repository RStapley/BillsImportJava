Domestic Reduction In Vehicle Expenditure Act or the DRIVE Act

Requires the Office of Management and Budget to determine: (1) the total number of civilian vehicles purchased and leased by each executive agency in FY2010, (2) the total dollar amount obligated by each executive agency to purchase and to lease civilian vehicles in FY2010, and (3) the amount that would be 20% less than such total dollar amount. Prohibits each executive agency from obligating more than the reduced dollar amount for FY2010 to purchase and lease civilian vehicles in each of FY2016-FY2020. Exempts the purchase or procurement of any vehicle determined by the President to be essential for reasons of national security.

Requires the General Services Administration&#160;to ensure that agencies may share excess or unused vehicles for temporary or long-term use through the Federal Fleet Management System.</summary>
