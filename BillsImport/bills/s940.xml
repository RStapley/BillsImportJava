Simpler Tax Filing Act of 2015

Expresses the sense of Congress that the Internal Revenue Service should begin offering pre-prepared tax returns to as many taxpayers as possible by tax year 2020.

Requires the Department of the Treasury to report to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee on actions necessary to achieve the goal of offering pre-prepared tax returns to taxpayers by tax year 2020, with an analysis of the budgetary, administrative, and legislative barriers to achieving such goal, including the amount of appropriations that would be required.</summary>
