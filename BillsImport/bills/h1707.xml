Access to Frontline Health Care Act of 2015

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish and carry out a Frontline Providers Loan Repayment Program under which HHS makes student loan repayments in exchange for a health professional providing frontline care services for two years in a frontline care scarcity area.

Frontline care services include surgery, optometry, physical therapy, pharmacies, public health, dietetics, occupational therapy, pediatrics, and medical technology.

Frontline care scarcity areas are federal health professional shortage areas and areas, populations, or facilities designated by a state as having a shortage of frontline care services.</summary>
