BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act

Requires the Department of Health and Human Services to: (1) issue a revised safety assessment for food containers composed in whole or in part of bisphenol A (BPA), taking into consideration different types and uses of such containers; and (2) determine whether there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to BPA through food containers or other items composed in whole or in part of BPA, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low-dose exposure and the effects of exposure on vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, infants, children, the elderly, and populations with high exposure to BPA.

Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of a food if its container is composed in whole or in part of BPA unless the label includes the following statement: "This food packaging contains BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, according to the National Institutes of Health."</summary>
