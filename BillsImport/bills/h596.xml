The instructions contained in the motion seek to require the bill to be reported back to the House with an amendment to ensure that the Affordable Care Act cannot be repealed if: (1) insurance companies are once again allowed to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions or gender; (2) premiums or out-of-pocket costs increase for Medicare part D patients; or (3) middle class families are forced to pay a tax increase due to the loss of premium tax credits.

(Sec. 1) This bill repeals the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the health care provisions of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The repeal is effective 180 days after enactment of this Act. Provisions of law amended by the repealed provisions are restored.

(Sec. 3) The Committees on Education and the Workforce, Energy and Commerce, the Judiciary, and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives must report legislation within each committee's jurisdiction with provisions that:

 foster economic growth and private sector job creation; lower health care premiums; preserve a patient's ability to keep their health plan; provide people with preexisting conditions access to affordable health coverage; reform the medical liability system to reduce unnecessary health care spending; increase the number of insured Americans; protect the doctor-patient relationship; provide states greater flexibility to administer Medicaid programs while reducing costs; expand incentives to encourage personal responsibility for health care coverage and costs; prohibit taxpayer funding of abortions and provide conscience protections for health care providers; eliminate duplicative government programs and wasteful spending; or do not accelerate the growth of entitlement programs or increase the tax burden on Americans.</summary>
