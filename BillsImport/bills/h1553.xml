  <summary>3/23/2015--Introduced.
Small Bank Exam Cycle Reform Act of 2015 

This bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to increase from $500 million to $1 billion the asset size of small insured depository institutions eligible for 18-month on-site examination cycles.

Such an institution is also qualified for the 18-month cycle if its total assets are at most $200 million (currently $100 million) and the most recent examination found its composite condition to be good rather than outstanding.

A federal banking agency is granted discretion to increase this assets ceiling amount from $200 million to $1 billion (currently from $100 million to $500 million) if that greater asset size would be consistent with the principles of safety and soundness.</summary>
