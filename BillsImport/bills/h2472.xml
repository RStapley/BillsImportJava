Everson Walls and Ron Springs Gift for Life Act of 2015

This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Health Resources and Services Administration to establish a National Organ and Tissue Donor Registry Resource Center.

The Center must: (1) advance the development, expansion, and evaluation of state organ donor registries; (2) facilitate timely exchange of donor information between state registries; and (3) maintain a clearinghouse for information on registry best practices.

The Department of Health and Human Services must award grants to states in order to develop, expand, or maintain state organ donor registries and establish benchmarks for improvement in organ donation. A state registry that receives a grant must be accessible to individual donors and the Center.

A person taking an individual's organs is not civilly liable as long as the person verified the individual's consent with a state organ donor registry.

The Government Accountability Office must study the feasibility of establishing a database to track the health effects of living organ donation.</summary>
