  <summary>1/7/2015--Introduced.
Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2015 

 States that it is U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel.

 Amends the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 to eliminate the President's authority to waive certain funding limitations for Department of State acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad until the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened.

Requires any official U.S. document which lists countries and their capital cities to identify Jerusalem as Israel's capital.

Limits appropriations that may be obligated in FY2015 for Department acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad until the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened.

States that for each of FY2016-FY2017, of funds authorized to be appropriated for Department acquisition and maintenance of buildings abroad, necessary sums should be made available until expended only for construction and other costs associated with the establishment in Jerusalem of the U.S. Embassy in Israel.</summary>
