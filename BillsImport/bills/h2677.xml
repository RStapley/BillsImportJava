This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, with respect to eligibility for consolidation loans, to require verification of a borrower's status by the Department of Education in the following cases:

 for obtaining income-contingent or -based repayment, and only if the loan has been submitted to the guaranty agency for default aversion or where the loan is already in default; for the purposes of using the public service loan forgiveness program; or for the purpose of using the no accrual of interest benefit for active duty service members.</summary>
