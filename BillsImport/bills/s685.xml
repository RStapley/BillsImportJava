This bill defines "autocycle" as a motor vehicle with three wheels, an enclosed occupant compartment, and a steering wheel, which meets applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Specified interim automotive and motorcycle safety standards apply to autocycles until at most three years after enactment of this Act, by which time the Secretary of Transportation shall issue appropriate final rules, interpretations, and test procedures.

Automotive fuel standards also apply to autocyles.</summary>
