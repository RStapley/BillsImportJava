DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015

(Sec. 2) Directs the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to report on:

 the number of information technology systems at DHS; the number of such systems exhibiting duplication or fragmentation (i.e., where there are two or more systems or programs that deliver similar functionality to similar user populations); a strategy for reducing such duplicative systems, including an assessment of potential cost savings; and a methodology for determining which system should be eliminated when there is duplication or fragmentation.</summary>
