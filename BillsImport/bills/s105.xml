Red Snapper Management Improvement Act

This bill gives Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (Gulf coastal states) exclusive authority to manage and conserve the red snapper in both the waters of each Gulf coastal state and the exclusive economic zone in the Gulf of Mexico if each of those states agree to a fishery management plan for the stainability of the red snapper and the economic and community benefits of the Gulf coastal states.

If each of those states agrees to a fishery management plan, Department of Commerce must provide appropriate funding to them for stock assessments and data collection related to the red snapper fishery.</summary>
