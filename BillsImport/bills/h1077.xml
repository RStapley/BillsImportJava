Casa Grande Ruins National Monument Boundary Modification Act of 2015 

 This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to acquire specified private or state lands or interests from willing sellers in order to expand the boundaries of the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument.

Two additional parcels of land are also to be included in the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. One parcel of 3.8 acres is currently being administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The other parcel of 7.41 acres currently being administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is exchanged for 3.5 acres of land currently being administered by the National Park Service (NPS). That land is to be used by BIA for the San Carlos Irrigation Project.

 As consideration for the acquisition of state and private lands under this Act, unless such lands are donated, Interior must: (1) pay fair market value; or (2) convey to the state of Arizona and private land owners federal lands, interest in federal land, or any other federal asset of equal value located in Arizona.

Interior may enter into an agreement with the state of Arizona to provide for cooperative management of approximately 200 acres of specified state trust lands.</summary>
