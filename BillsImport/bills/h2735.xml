Accountable Recovery Act 

This bill amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to direct the Department of the Interior or the Department of Commerce as appropriate to make recovery plans for the conservation and survival of a species publicly available at the time of a determination that the species is endangered or threatened. The plans must incorporate objective numerical recovery goals for removal of species from the endangered and threatened species list.

The appropriate department is given 30 days to deny a petition stating that the numerical recovery goal has been achieved for a species. If the department has not acted on a petition at the end of that period, the species is removed from the endangered and threatened species.</summary>
