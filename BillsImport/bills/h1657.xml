Fairness for Americans in Internal Revenue Refunds Act

This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to prevent a taxpayer whose social security number was issued for purposes of granting a work authorization under a deferred action on removal program from claiming an earned income tax credit using such social security number. The bill directs: (1) the Department of Homeland Security to place a notation on employment authorization cards that the holder of such card has received it under a deferred action on removal program, and (2) the Social Security Administration to maintain a record of all social security account numbers issued to individuals under a deferred action on removal program.</summary>
