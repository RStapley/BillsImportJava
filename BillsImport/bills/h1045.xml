District of Columbia Local Prosecutor Establishment Act of 2015

This bill amends the District of Columbia Code to shift the responsibility for conducting prosecutions for violations of District of Columbia laws from the Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia [Attorney General for the District] or the Attorney General's assistants to the head of the office designated under District local law as the one responsible for conducting such prosecutions (local prosecutor's office) or the local prosecutor's assistants.

An indictment or information brought in the name of:

 the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District may include charges of offenses prosecutable by the District if the head of the local prosecutor's office consents to such inclusion in writing, and the District in the Superior Court of the District may be joined for trial in the U.S. District Court for the District with an indictment or information brought in that court if the offenses charged could have been joined in the same indictment or information and if the head of the local prosecutor's office consents to such joinder. Nothing in this Act shall affect the authority of the Attorney General or the U.S. Attorney for the District to exercise jurisdiction concerning violations of federal laws.</summary>
