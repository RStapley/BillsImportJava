Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Research and Education Act of 2015

Requires the National Institutes of Health to expand, intensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and support of research on triple-negative breast cancer (breast cancers whose cells are negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and the HER2 protein).

Directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop and disseminate to the public information regarding triple-negative breast cancer, including information on: (1) the incidence and prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer among women, (2) the elevated risk for minority women, and (3) the availability of a range of treatment options.

Requires the Health Resources and Services Administration to develop and disseminate information on triple-negative breast cancer to health care providers.</summary>
