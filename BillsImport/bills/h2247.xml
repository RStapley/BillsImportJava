Increasing Clarity for Doctors by Transitioning Effectively Now Act or the ICD-TEN Act

This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement, administer, and enforce regulations that provide for the replacement of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) ICD-9 with ICD-10 as a standard for code sets.

HHS shall conduct, and make available to all participating service providers and suppliers, a comprehensive, end-to-end testing process to assess whether the Medicare fee-for-service claims processing system based on the ICD-10 standard is fully functioning.

HHS must subsequently certify to Congress whether or not the Medicare fee-for-service claims processing system based on the ICD-10 standard is fully functioning, including additional steps a not-fully-functioning system will take to achieve certification as well as the anticipated time frame for achieving it.</summary>
