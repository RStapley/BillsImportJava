  <summary>5/7/2015--Introduced.
Department of Veterans Affairs Employee Fairness Act of 2015

This bill repeals the exclusion from the collective bargaining rights of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) employees of regulations of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) addressing any matter or question concerning professional conduct or competence, peer review, or the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation.

As a result VHA employees may participate in collective bargaining with the VA over such regulations.</summary>
