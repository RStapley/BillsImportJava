Expresses support for the designation of National Innovation in Education Day to recognize the advances that the nation's schools have made incorporating both creative teaching methods and technology into the classroom.

Recognizes:

 the importance of creative teaching methods as a means of engaging students in their education and inspiring more students to pursue higher education; that technological advancements within the classroom prepare students for a more information-driven market, thus closing the gap between education and the workforce by allowing students to obtain the skills necessary for employment in competitive science and technology fields in the United States; and the achievements of outstanding educators who have exemplified innovative teaching methods.</summary>
