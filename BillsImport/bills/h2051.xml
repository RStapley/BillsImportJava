(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on May 29, 2015. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015 

This bill amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to extend and revise the Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) livestock mandatory price reporting requirements.

(Sec. 2) The bill extends the authority for continuing mandatory livestock price reporting through FY2020. Current authority expires at the end of FY2015. USDA must continue to receive and publish the required daily reporting information during a government shutdown.

(Sec. 3) USDA must begin reporting specified price details regarding certain negotiated purchases of swine. USDA must include required information that occurs after the afternoon reporting deadline in reports for the next day.

(Sec. 4) USDA must revise regulations to modify the definitions of "packer" and "importers" for the purpose of lamb reporting requirements.

USDA must include only importers that imported an average of 1,000 metric tons of lamb meat products per year during the previous four years, or importers that USDA determines should be included based on the volume of lamb imports.

Packers must include entities with at least 50% ownership in a facility as well as a federally inspected processing plant that slaughtered or processed the equivalent of an average of 35,000 head of lambs per year during the previous five years. USDA may include other processing plants that should be considered packers based on capacity.

(Sec. 5) The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service must consult with relevant market participants to study and report to Congress on the implementation of livestock mandatory price reporting.</summary>
