  <summary>5/6/2015--Introduced.
Energy Distribution Act of 2015

This bill requires the Department of Energy to collaborate with other federal agencies to improve the conceptual development of energy security, considering at a minimum:

 development of flexible, transparent, and competitive energy markets, including natural gas and oil markets; diversification of energy fuels, sources, and routes; and encouragement of indigenous sources of energy supply. The Department must: (1) lead an interagency effort to improve and coordinate data collection and analytical and modeling capabilities for energy distribution on shared energy infrastructure; and (2) coordinate the training of, and enhanced dialogue among, technical staff in federal agencies responsible for cross-border energy projects evaluation and implementation.

 The Administrator of the Energy Information Administration must collaborate with officials in Canada and Mexico to improve:

 the quality and transparency of North American energy data through reconciliation of data on energy trade flows among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico; the extension of energy mapping capabilities in those countries; and the development of common energy data terminology among the three nations.</summary>
