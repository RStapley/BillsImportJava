  <summary>3/18/2015--Introduced.
Extends whistleblower protections to employees of contractors, subcontractors, or grantees of elements of the intelligence community who disclose information regarding such an element, or its activities, if the employee complies with procedures to report urgent concerns to Congress by first submitting the information to an appropriate agency Inspector General under the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 or the Inspector General Act of 1978. (Currently, employees of contractors of the intelligence community are excluded from certain whistleblower protections that are provided to employees of&#160;contractors of the&#160;Department of Defense and other federal agencies.)

Requires courts that receive&#160;a disclosure of information required by executive order to be kept classified (in the interests of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs) to treat the information in a manner consistent with the interests of the national security of the United States, including through the use of summaries or ex parte submissions if the element of the intelligence community concerned advises the court that such procedures are warranted.</summary>
