Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2015 

Amends titles II (Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance), VIII (Special Benefits for Certain World War II Veterans), and XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act to prohibit from receiving benefits under those titles any individual who is the subject of: (1) an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony, or (2) an outstanding arrest warrant for violating a condition of prohibition or parole imposed under federal or state law.

Directs the Social Security Administration (SSA) to furnish any federal, state, or local law enforcement officer, upon written request, with the current address, Social Security number, and photograph of any recipient of title VIII benefits if the officer furnishes the SSA with the individual's name and other identifying information as reasonably required to establish the individual's unique identity, and notifies the SSA that: (1) the individual is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, or the individual is violating a condition of probation or parole; and (2) the location or apprehension of such individual is within the officer's official duties.</summary>
