  <summary>4/30/2015--Passed Senate without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Expresses sympathy to, and support for, the people of Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China who face catastrophic conditions in the aftermath of the April 25, 2015, earthquake, and sympathy for the families of the U.S. citizens who perished in the disaster.

Applauds the mobilization by President Obama to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Nepal, and the hard work of the people at the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Department of Defense in marshaling resources to address Nepal's needs.

Urges that all efforts be made to secure the safety of orphans in Nepal, and to support the people of Nepal with humanitarian, developmental, and infrastructure assistance needed to overcome the earthquake's effects.

Expresses appreciation for the international community's commitment to Nepal's recovery and development.

Calls on the government of Nepal to take all necessary actions to enable a faster and more sustainable recovery.

 Supports the U.S. Embassy team in Kathmandu, Disaster Assistance Response Team members, other federal agencies, and the U.S. non-governmental organizations who are working to assist thousands of people in Nepal under adverse conditions.</summary>
