Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015

Directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to promulgate a rule requiring liquid nicotine containers to be designed with special packaging that is difficult for children under five years of age to open or to obtain harmful contents from. Requires the rule to be treated as a standard applicable to a household substance under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.

 Defines a "liquid nicotine container" to: (1) include a consumer product consisting of a container that has an opening from which nicotine in a solution or other form is accessible and can flow freely through normal and foreseeable use by a consumer and that is used to hold soluble nicotine in any concentration; and (2) exclude nicotine in a solution or other form in a sealed, pre-filled, disposable container inserted directly into an electronic cigarette or other similar device, so long as the nicotine is inaccessible or cannot flow freely out of the device through normal and foreseeable use.

Requires the CPSC, within three years after enactment of this Act, to report to Congress regarding the promulgation of and any enforcement actions taken under the rule.</summary>
