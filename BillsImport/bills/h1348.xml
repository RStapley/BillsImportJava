  <summary>3/10/2015--Introduced.
Health Insurance Freedom Act of 2015

This bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to allow health insurance that meets state and federal benefit requirements as of October 1, 2013, to be sold on health insurance exchanges. Such insurance fulfills an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage but is not eligible for premium assistance and is not treated as a bronze, silver, gold, or platinum plan. Currently, health insurance must provide the essential health benefits to be sold on health insurance exchanges and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.</summary>
