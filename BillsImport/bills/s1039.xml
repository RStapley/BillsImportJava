Requires the Department of Energy (DOE), assisted by its chief information officer, to submit each year, beginning in FY2015 through FY2019, to the Office of E-Government and Information Technology of the Office of Management and Budget: (1) a comprehensive asset inventory of the data centers owned, operated, or maintained by or on behalf of DOE; and (2) an updated consolidation plan for such data centers. Requires the DOE Inspector General to issue a public report evaluating the completeness of the DOE asset inventory.

Requires the Office of E-Government and Information Technology to: (1) establish the deadline, on an annual basis, for agencies to submit information required by this Act; (2) develop and publish a goal for the total amount of planned cost savings through the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative during a five-year period and report on the actual savings achieved through the Initiative; and (3) report to Congress on DOE data center cost savings. Directs the Government Accountability Office to publish an annual report on DOE asset inventory and consolidation plans and DOE's implementation of such plans.

Requires DOE to migrate to cloud computing in a manner consistent with federal guidelines on cloud computing security, including applicable provisions in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program of the General Services Administration and guidance published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Authorizes the Director of National Intelligence to waive requirements of this Act for any element of the intelligence community.
