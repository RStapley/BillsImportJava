  <summary>5/13/2015--Introduced.
Medicare Patient Safety and Drug Abuse Prevention Act 

Amends part D (Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to authorize a prescription drug plan (PDP) sponsor to establish a drug management program for at-risk beneficiaries.

Requires a PDP sponsor, with respect to covered part D drugs, to have in place, directly or through appropriate arrangements, a utilization management tool designed to prevent: (1) the abuse of frequently abused drugs by individuals, and (2) the diversion of such drugs at pharmacies.

Directs the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to authorize Medicare drug integrity contractors (MEDICs) to accept directly an individual's prescription and necessary medical records from pharmacies, PDPs, and physicians in order for MEDICs to provide information relevant to determining whether the individual is an at-risk beneficiary.

Requires the Inspector General of HHS to study the effectiveness of MEDICs in identifying, combating, and preventing fraud under the Medicare program.

Expresses the sense of Congress that Medicare Advantage organizations and PDP sponsors should consider using e-prescribing and other health information technology tools to support combating fraud under MA-PD plans and prescription drug plans under parts C (Medicare+Choice) and D.</summary>
