Authority for the Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Act

This bill authorizes the President to use the U.S. Armed Forces for three years against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), any closely related successor entity, or associated persons or forces.

This bill shall also constitute the sole statutory authority for U.S. military action against ISIL, superseding any prior authorization for the use of military force against ISIL.

The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 is repealed.</summary>
