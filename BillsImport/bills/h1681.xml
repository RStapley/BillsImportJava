VA Construction, Accountability, and Reform Act

This bill authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out the major medical facility project to replace the VA Medical Center in Denver, Colorado (Aurora Project).

 The Secretary may not pay any bonus during FY2015-FY2016. If the Aurora Project is not completed by September 30, 2016, the Secretary may not pay any bonus until the date on which the Secretary certifies to Congress that such Project is fully operational. The aggregate amount of subsequent fiscal year bonuses is capped through FY2024.

 The Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Army for the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out the design, contract, construction management, and other similar services for the Aurora Project.

The bill prohibits the VA Secretary from carrying out a major medical facility project and requires the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to carry out all major medical facility projects for the VA.

 The Government Accountability Office shall review the Secretary's management of the Aurora Project.

 The Secretary must notify Congress at least 120 days (currently, at least 30 days) before obligating funds for major medical facility projects that exceed authorized amounts.</summary>
