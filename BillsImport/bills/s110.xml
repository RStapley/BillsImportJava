Environmental Protection Agency Accountability Act of 2015

This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to satisfy within 30 days regulatory requirements concerning:

 improving planning and regulator review under Executive Order 13563, Executive Order 12866, or any successor executive order establishing requirements applicable to the uniform reporting of regulatory and deregulatory agendas; publishing in the Federal Register its regulatory flexibility agendas; certifying compliance with Executive Order 13132 when transmitting any draft final regulation or proposed legislation that has federalism implication to the Office of Management and Budget; and preparing statements to accompany significant regulatory actions. If the EPA fails to satisfy these requirements, financial penalties in the form of funding rescissions will be imposed on the EPA each week until all the requirements are satisfied. In any year in which funds are rescinded, the EPA Inspector General must conduct an audit to assess the EPA's compliance with this Act.</summary>
