Judgment Fund Transparency Act of 2015 

This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to disclose details after payments are made from the Judgment Fund. The Judgment Fund is a permanent and indefinite appropriation to pay judgments against the United States, including awards, compromise settlements, and related interest and costs.

Unless the disclosure is prohibited by law or a court order, Treasury must make available to the public on a website:

 the name of the agency or entity whose actions gave rise to the claim or judgment, the plaintiff or claimant, the counsel for the plaintiff or claimant, the amount paid, a description of the facts that gave rise to the claim, and the name of the agency that submitted the claim.</summary>
</bill>
