(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)

Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act 

(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from gross income, for income tax purposes, amounts paid: (1) by the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the Department of Justice as a public safety officer survivor's benefit or a public safety officer disability benefit, or (2) under a state program that provides compensation for surviving dependents of a public safety officer who has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty. The tax exclusion does not apply to any amounts that would have been payable if the death of the public safety officer had occurred other than as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.</summary>
