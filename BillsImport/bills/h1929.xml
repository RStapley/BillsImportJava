International Conflicts of Concern Act

Directs the President to identify to Congress each country whose government is, and each country in which anti-government forces are, allowing one or more foreign terrorist organizations to engage in armed conflict occurring in that country.

Directs the President to designate a country as a "country of conflict concern" if: (1) its government or anti-government forces in the country are allowing one or more foreign terrorist organizations to engage in armed conflict in it, and (2) it is in the U.S. national security to restrict travel by any U.S. national to the country and restrict material support by U.S. nationals of entities engaged in armed conflict in it. Terminates such a designation when the President certifies to Congress that either or both of these circumstances no longer apply.

Deems Syria to be a country of conflict concern.

Directs the President, with respect to a country of conflict concern, to require a U.S. national to obtain a license to: (1) travel to it, or (2) provide material support to entities engaged in armed conflict in it. Applies specified penalties to a person who violates such requirements.</summary>
