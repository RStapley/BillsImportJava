Visa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act regarding the visa waiver program to: (1) authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate any country as a program country; (2) adjust visa refusal rate criteria, including addition of a 3% maximum overstay rate; and (3) revise probationary and termination provisions.

Directs the Secretary to submit to Congress: (1) an evaluation of the security risks of aliens who enter the United States without an approved Electronic System for Travel Authorization verification, and (2) a description of any improvements needed to minimize the number of aliens who enter the United States without such verification.

 Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary, in evaluating visa waiver program countries, should prioritize the reviews of countries in which circumstances indicate that such review is necessary or desirable.</summary>
