Keeping our Promises to Veterans Act of 2015

This bill amends the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 regarding the veterans choice program to:

 reduce the 40-mile radius requirement to 20 miles, and require that the closest medical facility is able to provide a veteran with the care and services needed; reduce the 30-day wait-time goal to 15 days; and require the Veterans Administration (VA) to implement the prompt payment system by the earlier of February 1, 2016, or 180 days after the Comptroller General submits a certain report on the timeliness of VA payments for hospital care, medical services, and other health care furnished by non-VA health care providers.</summary>
