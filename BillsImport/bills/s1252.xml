  <summary>5/7/2015--Introduced.
Global Food Security Act of 2015 

This bill requires the President or a designee to coordinate the development and implementation of a whole-of-government Feed the Future Strategy to accomplish the objectives of: eradicating hunger and malnutrition, especially for women and children; assisting foreign countries to achieve long-term, sustainable, and inclusive agricultural development; and ensuring the effective use of taxpayer dollars to further these objectives.

The bill sets forth requirements for the Strategy and requires the President or a designee to coordinate the efforts of relevant federal departments and agencies in implementing the Strategy by:

 establishing policy coherence, monitoring and evaluation systems, and coordination across all relevant departments and agencies; aligning linkages with other initiatives and strategies of federal agencies; establishing platforms for regular consultation and collaboration with stakeholders; leveraging the expertise of the Department of Agriculture in agricultural development, nutrition, trade, research, and education; and establishing and leading regular public consultations in target countries. For the purposes of carrying out this bill, assistance may be provided to the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.

Beginning no later than one year after enactment of this bill, the President or a designee must report annually to Congress on the status of the implementation of the Strategy. The Government Accountability Office must also report to Congress on the progress of the Strategy.</summary>
