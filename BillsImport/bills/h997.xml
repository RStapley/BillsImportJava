English Language Unity Act of 2015

Establishes English as the official language of the United States.

Requires&#160;naturalization ceremonies and official functions of the U.S. government, subject to exceptions, to&#160;be conducted in English.

Declares that all citizens should be able to read and understand generally the English language text of U.S. laws.

Allows a person injured by a violation of this Act to obtain relief, including a declaratory judgment, in a civil action.

Declares that English language requirements and workplace policies, whether in the public or private sector,&#160;shall be presumptively consistent with U.S. laws. Requires any ambiguity in&#160;U.S. laws&#160;to be resolved in accordance with the rights retained by the people and the powers reserved to states under the Bill of Rights.

Directs the Department of Homeland Security to issue a proposed rule for uniform testing of the English language ability of candidates for naturalization based upon the principles that: (1) all citizens should be able to read and understand generally the English language text of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the laws of the United States; and (2) any exceptions to this standard should be limited to extraordinary circumstances, such as asylum.</summary>
