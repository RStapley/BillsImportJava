  <summary>3/26/2015--Introduced.
Expresses support for the goals and ideals of National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month.

Calls for recognition of: (1) national and community organizations and private sector supporters for their work in promoting awareness about sexual assault, providing information and treatment to survivors of sexual assault, and increasing the number of successful prosecutions of perpetrators of sexual assault; and (2) public safety, law enforcement, and health professionals for their hard work and innovative strategies to increase the percentage of sexual assault cases that result in the prosecution and incarceration of its perpetrators.

Urges national and community-based organizations, private businesses, colleges and universities, and the media to promote, through such Month, awareness of sexual violence, resources for its survivors and their friends and family members, and strategies to decrease the incidence of sexual assault.</summary>
