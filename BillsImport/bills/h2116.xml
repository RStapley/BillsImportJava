  <summary>4/29/2015--Introduced.
Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act of 2015 

Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish a visa waiver program for the United States Virgin Islands for a national of a country that is a member or an associate member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) listed in regulations under this Act and who is applying for admission as a nonimmigrant business or pleasure visitor solely for entry into and stay in the United States Virgin Islands for not more than 30 days, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that such waiver does not represent a threat to the welfare or security of the United States or its territories and commonwealths.

Directs the Secretary to suspend the admission of nationals of a country if such admissions have resulted in an unacceptable number of visitors remaining unlawfully in the United States Virgin Islands, unlawfully obtaining entry to other parts of the United States, or seeking withholding of removal or asylum, or that visitors from such country pose a risk to law enforcement or security interests of the United States Virgin Islands or of the United States.

Authorizes the Secretary to suspend the program at any time, on a country-by-country basis, for other good cause.

Provides for the addition of program countries.</summary>
