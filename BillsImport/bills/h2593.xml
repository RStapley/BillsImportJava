  <summary>6/1/2015--Introduced.
Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require identification and description on the website of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of items to be decided by commissioner panels, employee boards, or individual commissioners or employees to whom the FCC has delegated its functions, unless the publication is likely to lead to the disclosure of certain classified national defense or foreign policy matters, internal personnel practices, trade secrets, personal information, investigatory records for law enforcement, or other deliberation information exempt from disclosure under federal administrative procedure laws.

Requires such identification and description to be published on the FCC website at least 48 hours before an order, decision, report, or action is made or taken pursuant to such a delegation of authority by the FCC.

Makes this Act inapplicable to a decision that: (1) does not receive a delegated authority number, (2) is delegated to an administrative law judge, or (3) is taken to address an immediate threat to health or safety that constitutes an emergency requiring an expedited response from the FCC.</summary>
