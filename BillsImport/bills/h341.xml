Requires a state, as a condition for receipt of a grant or contract from the Department of Labor for support of disabled veterans' outreach specialists and local veterans' employment representatives, to:

 establish a program that issues a license or credential to a veteran without requiring any training or apprenticeship if such veteran receives a satisfactory score on completion of an examination administered by that state and has at least 10 years of experience in a military occupational specialty that is similar to the civilian occupation for which such license or credential is required; and submit a report each year on the exams administered that includes the number of veterans who completed such exams and a description of the results of such exams, disaggregated by occupational field.</summary>
