Constitutional Amendment

Grants the United States and each state, territory, and possession the power to define marriage as limited to the union of one man and one woman.

Declares that: (1) nothing in this constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its legal incidents be conferred upon any union other than the union of one man and one woman or to require that a state recognize a marriage that was licensed in another state; and (2) no decision or order of any court to the contrary, including any decision or order issued before the date of ratification, shall have any force or effect.</summary>
