Autocycle Safety Act

This bill defines "autocycle" as a motor vehicle with three wheels, a fully enclosed occupant compartment, and a steering wheel, which is subject to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Specified interim automotive and motorcycle safety standards apply to autocycles until at most three years after enactment of this Act, by which time the Department of Transportation shall issue appropriate final rules, interpretations, and test procedures.

Automotive fuel standards also apply to autocyles.</summary>
