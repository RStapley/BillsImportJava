National Intersection and Interchange Safety Construction Program Act of 2015

This bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a national intersection and interchange safety construction grant program.

The Secretary may make competitive grants to a state or local government, U.S. territory, tribal government, or metropolitan planning organization for projects that:

 are eligible for federal-aid highway funding, and will improve the safety of certain intersections or interchanges on the National Highway System that are in immediate need of safety improvement. The aggregate grant amount provided to an entity in a fiscal year shall not exceed 5% of the amount available for all grants under the program in that fiscal year.</summary>
