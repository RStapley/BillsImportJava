Veterans Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Improvement Act of 2015

Allows a veteran to pursue a course of education and training as part of a rehabilitation program only if the course is approved under Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) vocational rehabilitation requirements.

Makes veterans enrolled in a VA vocational rehabilitation program eligible for VA specially adapted housing.

 Bars dual eligibility for home adaptation services.

Authorizes the VA to prioritize vocational rehabilitation services based on need and upon consideration of disability ratings, the severity of employment handicaps, qualification for a program of independent living, income, and other appropriate factors.

 Directs the VA to reduce information technology redundancy and inefficiencies in the rehabilitation claims process.</summary>
