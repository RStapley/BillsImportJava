(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

This bill amends the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2014 to establish a&#160;general effective date for the pay provisions of such Act as the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016, except that the provision in such Act relating to administering elections and making advance assignments to a regular tour of duty shall be applicable before such effective date to the extent deemed necessary by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM is authorized to issue regulations as necessary prior to such effective date.</summary>
