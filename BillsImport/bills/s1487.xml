  <summary>6/3/2015--Introduced.
Regulatory Predictability for Business Growth Act of 2015

This bill adds the definitions of "longstanding interpretative rule" and "revise" to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). A longstanding interpretative rule is distinguished from an "interpretative rule" if it has been in effect for not less than one&#160;year. If a rule is a longstanding interpretative rule, it remains subject to the general notice of proposed rulemaking and comment and publication provisions of the APA.</summary>
