Regional Gas Consumer Protection Act

This bill amends the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, before approving or disapproving an application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, to consider: (1) regional constraints in the U.S. natural gas supply, and (2) whether the application includes provisions of benefit to the regional consumers that would be affected by the exportation of natural gas.</summary>
