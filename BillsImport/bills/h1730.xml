  <summary>3/26/2015--Introduced.
Amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to recognize Alexander Creek, Alaska, as a Native village eligible for land and benefits under the Act.

Requires Alexander Creek to file any amendments to its corporate charter in Alaska that are necessary to convert from a Native group to a Native Village Corporation.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior to open negotiations with Alexander Creek to reach an agreement to settle Alexander Creek's aboriginal land claims and any other claims of such Native Village Corporation against the United States fairly and equitably.

Requires Alexander Creek to notify each member of the Native village that: (1) all of them will cease to receive benefits from Cook Inlet Region Incorporated (CIRI) individually as at-large shareholders, and (2) all future resource payments from the Region will be made to the Village Corporation. Relieves CIRI from liability under any state, federal, or local law for damages related to that payment cessation.</summary>
