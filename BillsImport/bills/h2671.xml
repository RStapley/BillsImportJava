Recruit Act

This bill specifies that a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health professional scholarship shall consist of up to the full amount of the tuition and other reasonable educational expenses for a school year.

The period of obligated service may exceed one calendar year for each such school year or part thereof if the VA determines that such period is appropriate based on the scholarship's amount and duration.

An individual who is enrolled in such program as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act may elect to be covered by the amendments made by this Act with respect to a quarter, semester, or term commencing on or after the date of enactment of this Act.</summary>
