  <summary>6/18/2015--Introduced.
Recognizes the three-year anniversary of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) program, which permits young people who were brought to the United States by their parents as children to remain temporarily in the United States and make meaningful contributions to our country.

Acknowledges that the country benefits when we fully integrate hardworking immigrants.

 Recognizes that the President's DACA program, along with his recent constitutionally sound executive actions on immigration, serve as the precursor to legislative action.</summary>
