Fair Adjustment and Income Revenue for Social Security Act or the FAIR Social Security Act 

This bill repeals the cap on the amount of income ($118,500 in 2015) that is subject to the employment or self-employment tax for funding social security benefits. The bill also reallocates employment and self-employment tax revenues to increase Social Security Trust Fund solvency.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor must prepare and publish an index for each calendar month to be known as the Consumer Price Index for Elderly Consumers that indicates changes in expenditures for consumption that are typical for individuals who are 62 years of age or older. This Index will be used to adjust benefit amounts under the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program and Medicare.</summary>
