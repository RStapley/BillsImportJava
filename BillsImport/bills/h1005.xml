Renewable Energy Jobs Act 

This bill requires the Department of Labor to carry out a pilot program to train individuals for careers in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries, specifically:

 the energy-efficient building, construction, or retrofits industry; the renewable electric power industry, including the wind, solar, and geothermal energy industries; or the energy efficiency assessment industry that serves the residential, commercial, or industrial sectors. Labor must also award grants under the program to the five states with the highest installed alternative energy power capacity, which is the amount of wind, solar, and geothermal power generation installed in a state.</summary>
